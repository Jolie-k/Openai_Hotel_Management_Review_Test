Capella Singapore,"I would give it negative stars if I could. Had a 3 night stay in one of the suites with a personal plunge pool. They cleaned the pool once during my entire stay and that’s only because I called and complained. Leaves and debris collect in the pool all day so it would have been nice if they had cleaned it daily so we could use it more than once. Service was the worst I’ve ever experienced. You’d call (at least 3 to 5 times before you get an answer) and ask for something and then 45 minutes after , you’d call again to ask again because it still hadn’t arrived. This happened on several occasions. I wrote a very long list of complaints such as ants all over the living room desk, to light shining in at night, to the cleanliness of the room, and there are many more but not worth anymore of my time. Buyer beware, it says 5 star and is ran like a motel (maybe a motel is even ran better). I made my complaints known, and after 3 nights at $1,400 a night they offered me a $200 credit on my stay.

Capella Singapore,"A massive disappointment - I booked the Capella for the whole family (5 of us) to celebrate my wife’s 50th birthday (20/21 March). If you’re looking for excellent customer service then go to Raffles where we celebrated my birthday last year in great style and with perfect service. At Capella (which was even more expensive), we received a cold welcome, a disaster at breakfast the following day (which wasted two hours of our morning) and the hotel double blocked my credit card, making it go over my limit and causing other transactions to be cancelled. Multiple requests for a senior manager to call me afterwards yielded zero response. I am shocked at the lack of any interest in following up on customer complaints.",tripadvisor.com.sg,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Check-In & Check-Out Process"", ""categories""=>[""Poor service"", ""Surprise charges or billing mistakes""]}, {""theme""=>""Staff & Service Quality"", ""categories""=>[""Rude, inattentive, or unhelpful staff"", ""Poor problem resolution (slow or dismissive responses)""]}, {""theme""=>""Food & Beverage Experience"", ""categories""=>[""Long wait times for in-room dining or restaurants""]}, {""theme""=>""Value-for-Money"", ""categories""=>[""Guests feeling the experience didn't justify the high price"", ""Comparing negatively to other 5-star or boutique hotels""]}]}"
Capella Singapore,"Poor hygiene practise in the pool with pool cleaner’s garden boots in it when we were in pool. We were even snubbed by the pool cleaner when we asked him politely if he could either clean the pool of the leaves barefooted or clean it from the parapet which was perhaps around 50cm below the pool surface. However to be fair, the other staff were friendly and polite, but this poor experience and bad attitude from the pool really killed everything.",tripadvisor.com.sg,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Staff & Service Quality"", ""categories""=>[""Rude, inattentive, or unhelpful staff""]}, {""theme""=>""Facilities & Infrastructure"", ""categories""=>[""Pool, spa, gym not functioning or poorly maintained""]}]}"
Capella Singapore,"My luggage didn't arrive to my room for 30+ minutes and when I called the front, they had forgotten to send my luggage. The villa they gave me was right across from a massive construction site so since my check-in at 3pm, I couldn't open my balcony doors because the noise was so loud. I had to request to transfer to another villa, but had to wait for 1-2 hours so couldn't make any plans to go hangout around the island area. And the first villa room arranged for me had a half used shampoo bottle with its cap opened.  I suggest you to check the location of the villa when they assign you one so you don't have to waste your time. 
The service in the main pool area was very poor and was not accounted for. the pool itself is very nice, but the bells placed in each beach table was useless. I went to the pool 2 times. Once in the morning and once in the afternoon. In the morning, I had to wait 20-30 minutes after pressing the bell and I had to call the main lobby via my cell phone to get someone to bring a towel and some drinks. In the afternoon, I was at the lowest floor of the pool for some quiet swimming time. I kept pressing the bell to get some towel and something to drink, but gave up after waiting for 30 minutes or so. It was a bit far down from the main floor so I couldn't bother to go all the way up to ask for a drink and come back down for swimming. I suggest you bring some drink from your room or make sure you let someone know you will be in a specific seat so you don't have to worry about getting thirsty.

Capella Singapore,"We  booked a staycation from 1 Nov to 3 Nov after our wedding lunch reception at Cassia, Capella's Chinese restaurant. We have expected a high level of service but was thoroughly disappointed by the stay. Below are some details:

1) We had requested for an early check-in so that we can use the room as an utility room for the wedding. However it was not granted given that the hotel was fully occupied. After the lunch reception, i headed to the lobby to check-in but was told in a rude and condescending tone by the door staff to line up properly. The strangest thing was that there was not even a visible line.

2) I was left standing at a corner for almost 20-30 min to wait for the check-in process to be done when I was finally allowed in. Comparatively, i see other guests comfortably sitting down on the sofas and served welcome drinks. Well, I guess I'm not as valued as other guests.

3) When I was finally shown into my room (Room 320; which is supposed to be the sea view room), the hotel staff excitedly exclaimed to me that I had booked a super-nice facing garden view. I corrected him saying I booked a sea-view room - and he almost looked frantic and pointed out a slight sea view at the side. Until today I'm still unsure if I got allocated the correct room.

4) i called housekeeping (which took an average of 45s to 60s for someone to pick up) to ask for some bathroom accessories, and inquired about the activities Capella offered and how we should go about booking the gym facilities. The hotel staff put me on hold to check (I would have thought the front desk would know this much better) and told me that 1) the activities at Capella were all chargeable, and 2) I should call the front desk to book the gym facilities. 

Imagine our surprise when we eventually found out that some of the activities were actually free for all guests (only on our last day), and when we tried booking the gym via a phone call, we were told to book it ourselves via the QR code provided on the desk. First of all, why were we told 2 different things by the hotel front desk. And secondly, why could the hotel front desk just offer to book it for us? It's these small staff that distinguishes a 5 star hotel with a 2 star hotel, and Capella felt like the latter.

5) When we eventually managed to book the gym session, we were surprised that our access cards did not allow entry into the gym. It was hard to even find a hotel staff in sight so we had to head to the lobby to ask for assistance, where we were told we had to check-in there and get our temperatures examined before we were allowed into the gym. Again no one told us about it, and we were getting frustrated by then while we voiced our displeasure to the front desk. 

He did give us $100 of dining vouchers to compensate for the lack of service - but putting  this in perspective, a night stay at Capella would cost upwards of $700 - what does $100 even matter? I would happily give up this $100 for a better service experience.

6) To make things worse - while we were working out in the gym, I saw another hotel guest standing right outside the doors and she apparently could have her temperature measured there instead of at the lobby. Again what is this differentiated treatment between hotel guests?

7) The room was spacious but was obviously dated. I could feel the springs of the bed (I had better sleep at some 2-3 star hotels abroad). The bath towels were dusty and caused my allergies to flare up. The bathroom faucet design was stupid - anyone that stayed there would agree.

8) Hotel guests were allowed to chill at the ""Living Room"" lounge. We were kindly offered drinks but it took forever to arrive (the staff actually forgot our orders twice).

9) I gave my feedback when we checked out and the front desk manager told us that they will take our feedback seriously - and that the management staff will be calling us after our stay. It has been a week since and I have yet to hear from them. I guess words are cheap. 

Also, he tried blaming the poor service standards to Covid measures (which has been around for the last 3 months). Surely a 5 star hotel like Capella should be able to adapt by now?

To be fair, Capella Singapore has its charms - the colonial and Bali-resort feel. But this is let down by the appalling service standards (there are much more which I am just lazy to list down at this point). I would urge everyone to spend their money at more deserving hotels - any of their competitors (Ritz Carlton, Mandarin Oriental, Fullerton) would have better service standards.

The only salvation was probably Cassia and Bob's Bar. Other than that, don't bother coming to this hotel.",tripadvisor.com.sg,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Reservation & Pre-Arrival"", ""categories""=>[""Inflexible Policies""]}, {""theme""=>""Check-In & Check-Out Process"", ""categories""=>[""Long Wait"", ""Poor service""]}, {""theme""=>""Room Assignment & Condition"", ""categories""=>[""Wrong room allocation (e.g., not the one booked)"", ""Maintenance issues (broken AC, shower, TV, etc.)"", ""Poor cleanliness (dirty linens, bad odors, pests)"", ""Outdated or worn-out furnishings""]}, {""theme""=>""Staff & Service Quality"", ""categories""=>[""Rude, inattentive, or unhelpful staff"", ""Lack of staff presence when needed"", ""Poor problem resolution (slow or dismissive responses)"", ""Over-promising but under-delivering on \""luxury\"" standards""]}, {""theme""=>""Food & Beverage Experience"", ""categories""=>[""Long wait times for in-room dining or restaurants""]}, {""theme""=>""Facilities & Infrastructure"", ""categories""=>[""Pool, spa, gym not functioning or poorly maintained""]}, {""theme""=>""Value-for-Money"", ""categories""=>[""Guests feeling the experience didn't justify the high price"", ""Comparing negatively to other 5-star or boutique hotels""]}]}"
Capella Singapore,"“I booked a staycation from Aug 7-9 2020. I was so looking forward to it. To be clear, the staff at the Knolls and spa were great. What you’d expect from a hotel of this caliber.  My trail of disappointments started when I got out of my Grab, and although there were over 5 staff outside, none welcomed me, made eye contact with me (I was literally less than a meter away from them) asked me if I was checking in (I had two weekender bags) nor offered to guide me into the lobby. I finally had to ask someone to open the door since I had my hands full. 

I checked in, the room was lovely, albeit needing a bit of an upgrade (the faucets were super hard to use). 
Upon checkout 2 nights later, I wanted to book a Garden or Palawan villa for the Christmas holidays 2020. My friend and I booked a room each for this stay, she was going to check out of her room later that day. 
I wrote to the reservations team and they got back to me 24 hours later with a rate. But I double checked with them since my friend had been offered (and booked) a rate that was $500 cheaper per night than mine (I was offered $1450 per night, she was offered $951 per night). 
The response I got, again, 24 hours later, was curt (2 lines) and felt very condescending. It simply said (paraphrasing): your friend has DISCOVERY membership. If you let me know your membership number I'll see what I can do. 

The e-mail didn't explain nor even considered that I may not have DISCOVERY membership (I don't and honestly didn't even know about it). 
So I wrote back and explained that my friend had been offered the membership upon checkout (same day I checked out) and given the rate on the spot. I also asked about the disparity in service (if she had been offered membership, why wasn't I and were there certain criteria you needed to meet before being offered it?) 
This was Wednesday August 12 2020. It's August 16 and it doesn't feel like anyone's going to reply to my e-mail (because my friend had already booked, I wrote to them and asked for a reply, nothing to date). 

I can only assume that they’ve decided I'm not really welcomed back at their resort and it honestly makes me feel not only embarrassed but extremely disrespected. I just wanted a simple reply. 

Really disappointing. I’ve travelled far and wide and have stayed at luxury hotels but this is not the sort of “response” you expect from the bookings office. Or the hotel in general.",tripadvisor.com.sg,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Check-In & Check-Out Process"", ""categories""=>[""Poor service""]}, {""theme""=>""Room Assignment & Condition"", ""categories""=>[""Maintenance issues (broken AC, shower, TV, etc.)""]}, {""theme""=>""Staff & Service Quality"", ""categories""=>[""Rude, inattentive, or unhelpful staff"", ""Poor problem resolution (slow or dismissive responses)""]}]}"
Capella Singapore,"Having tried to give my feedback to Capella’s culturist since 18 December and they did not even bother to revert to my feedback. Below are some details of my recent 3 nights stay at Capella Singapore (14-17 December):

1. Room card was deactivated on 15 Dec morning 1030AM, when I went back to the hotel after breakfast we were being locked out.

2. Went to the reception and the lady that assisted me was not honest and well trained. First she told me that I didn't check into my hotel stay properly that 3 nights were to be combined; but even if I stayed 1 night my cards cannot be deactivated in the morning the next day before checkout? After I told her that is not a reason, she told me that my room door lock is a bit faulty, just by scanning the cards at her counter it could miraculously fix the door lock? I didn’t want to continue speaking to her anymore so I head up to the library to ask the lady there to get her duty manager to call me back for explanation.

3. Later that day around noon time the duty manager Rudolph called and again say that due to my 3 separate booking caused some error. He offered to give my parent room late check out (as my parents were only staying one night) which we didn't take the offer and my parents checked out on time.

4. 16 December was my wife's birthday and I wanted to celebrate it well but alas the hotel have an annual electrical/water shutdown? Paying for full day rate but ""chased"" out of the hotel from early morning till 6pm?? email from hotel manager a few days before our trip mentioned that as guests affected we can choose attractions that we would like to go to spend the time outside the hotel, when I called to say we wanted to go to USS and also the SEA aquarium the reception told me that they only offer 1 attraction and since USS was the more expensive attraction they will help to get that for us... We are chased out of the hotel for the whole day not even getting any refund or compensation this is terrible.

5. I had booked Knolls for dinner at 630 pm so we had to drive back around 430pm from RWS, my son was sleeping and therefore we put him in our stroller. When we went to the lift lobby the lifts were not working! No staff around to assist us too, the stairs section was also closed for ""upgrading works"" So I had to push the stroller out of the carpark and climb the steep hill all the way back up to the hotel rooms.

6. We went back to our room around 6pm and we needed to shower to get ready for dinner which we called to push back to 7pm, we were greeted in horror to dirty brown water from all the taps, bathtub, shower, basin! (attached photos that I taken as proof!). We had these dirty water touching our skins when we tried to bath!

Since I cannot get a reply from their hotel culturist email since 18 December, I hope I can get some attention from the hotel’s senior management through this feedback to trip advisor. I have stayed at Capella a number of times and all the stays were top notch but this time it is really really bad.",tripadvisor.com.sg,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Reservation & Pre-Arrival"", ""categories""=>[""Booking Error""]}, {""theme""=>""Check-In & Check-Out Process"", ""categories""=>[""System Errors"", ""Poor service""]}, {""theme""=>""Room Assignment & Condition"", ""categories""=>[""Maintenance issues""]}, {""theme""=>""Staff & Service Quality"", ""categories""=>[""Rude, inattentive, or unhelpful staff"", ""Lack of staff presence when needed"", ""Poor problem resolution (slow or dismissive responses)""]}, {""theme""=>""Technology & Amenities"", ""categories""=>[""Malfunctioning room technology (smart locks, lighting, automation)""]}, {""theme""=>""Facilities & Infrastructure"", ""categories""=>[""Pool, spa, gym not functioning or poorly maintained""]}, {""theme""=>""Value-for-Money"", ""categories""=>[""Guests feeling the experience didn't justify the high price""]}]}"
Capella Singapore,"It was a family staycation at a famous 5 star hotel but unfortunately the experience was not quite right. 

Firstly, the check in experience was bad as I only got my room after the stipulated check in time of 3pm. I had a 4 month old baby with me upon check in and it would be helpful if the room could be earlier or on time. We had to constantly check with the service staff at the counter whether our rooms were ready. And actually 2 of our 5 rooms were ready but no one called to inform us. 

Secondly, as I am a nursing mother, I requested for someone to pick up my ice pack at night and return to me the next morning but no one came. We had to explain to the housekeeping guy (who was nice) but he didn’t quite understand what we wanted him to do. 

Thirdly and the most frustrating are the taps in the toilets. It is so difficult to turn open or close. 5 star hotel but 2 star toilet accessories. 

I have filled up their online feedback form 2 days ago and since then, no one called to find out more. 

This is my first time staying in Capella and honestly the price doesn’t match with the service experienced.

Capella Singapore,"The overall standards of service has dropped tremendously. Rooms are also not updated over the years. For this price you are paying, you can get a better accommodation elsewhere

1. We called ahead to inform we were going to arrive at 12-2pm and to expedite for us to have at least 1 room. Also to notify us if any of the rooms were available

2. We booked 5 rooms, and non of the rooms were ready at 2.45pm. We had to approach the front desk to check. Only to find out 3 of the rooms were ready and the cards were just sitting on their desks until we asked.

3. When I first arrived 1pm, my toddler had car sick and vomited all over her car seat. We asked the front desk if they had laundry service for car seat. They said no. But no concern or care was given and not even wanting to help expedite the room. For all the hotels I have been to, generally the frontdesk will give babies priority. My entourage consisted of 2 babies and yet no such care was given. Truly appalling 

4. The rooms were not updated. Bath tubs took forever to fill and the sink tap was so difficult to twist open. Feedback when checking out and the staff explained..

Capella Singapore,"Hi! During my stay in capella, i noticed one of your staff actually being very unprofessional towards her colleagues.

Capella Singapore,"Nice ambience but serious service is horrible!

We used to love our mini staycation where so much that we thought we would include our lil fur friend this time on our staycation. But the villa they allocated to us- villa27 (yes it’s near to the lobby and Knolls the restaurant) but Boy oh boy was it filthy! The carpets were dirty and reeked of the smell of urine. The shower stall had a musky smell which has totally unpleasant.

The personal assistants were suppose to help make your stay pleasant but they don’t know what is what.!  This 9th year anniversary package include a free heritage art tour which was booked for the 14th at 5pm, we arrived very promptly at the lobby at 5pm but no one was there and no one knew anything of the art tour being booked at all!!! Good grief!! No apologies nothing except a they will check by no one came back after 30mins that we decided just to stuff it and hear back to our pee smelling villa. 

Breakfast at Knolls was no better, staff ate totally non inattentive n dismissive. Kneeling that my daughter n I have food allergies n all the restaurants have been notified , special menus have been requested for but they just directed me to the buffet spread and just asked me to look at for the gluten free items. However our food allergies are not just restricted to gluten!!

That aside the staff driving the buggies deserve be to be applauded they have always been more then kind to always give us a lift back to the villa when it was just a short walk from the lobby. They seem to be the only staff worth to be applauded when all the rest of the lack lusture staff just seem to bring down the Capella service standards.

Capella Singapore,Very disappointed with the experience I had here. It was supposed to be a very highly acclaimed hotel in Sentosa Singapore. But the experience right from stepping into the hotel and the check in process was really bad. My family and I took the long weekend on Hari Raya for a staycation at Capella. We practically wasted whole day just to check in. We were told check in time was 1:00pm. So we went there at 1:00pm. Waited for more than half an hour to get one villa  and was told the second villa will be ready by 3:00pm. We waited until 4:00pm and still nothing. Call many times and the answer is that they are checking.

Capella Singapore,"Worn and tired faded glory
For a hotel that positions itself as a luxury Singapore hotel is certainly falls short. 

I'm guessing it opened it the mid-1990's and the rooms certainly look like they haven't been touched since. Another negative is that it sells itself as a retreat from the city but in actual fact the noise from the waterway and neighboring building developments destroy whatever peace may have existed when Sentosa opened.

For the price I would have preferred to stay in the Marina Bay.

Capella Singapore,"It's acceptable that the room service is 50 minutes later than arranged. It's also OK if you clean the plunge pool every 3 days. 
But if on the day of my check out they call me afternoon 3 pm asking me what am I doing in the villa because the latest check out is 2 pm, well that's not that acceptable anymore. Especially as I asked the reception a week before, that I would like to arrange a late check out at 10 pm, of course no problem if it is for a fee. They called me 5 minutes later confirming that it is OK, even arranging a baggage pick up for my checkout date at 9:45 pm...
The lady who called me on the day of check out of course was not aware of this just when I told her, then she said sorry. She called back a minute after telling me there is a guest waiting for the villa and asking us to perhaps leave earlier, they would put us in a different room. I asked her how are we even having this conversation, after 10 pm was confirmed previously then a few minutes ago also everything was OK and clear. I am not even packed my luggage, what if I would be in town or at the pool somewhere? Totally unprofessional dealings, especially when you are travelling with your girlfriend and a 6 year old boy. If they tell me, late check out is not available, that's OK, I get it. Or if they contact me a day before check out asking us if we can move to another room because they have a guest coming, again understandable and no problems with that. But to act surprised the day of your check out at 3 pm, that I'm still in the room, when a late check out was previously arranged...I don' t think that's normal or acceptable in a hotel like this.
So after the last call we packed in 30 minutes, ordered the baggage pick up and went to check out. The lady at the reception gave me the invoice and asked to check it out, if everything was correct. It was fine and I paid with a card, she gave me the invoice and that' s it. Nothing else, not even apologized for what just happened, did not offer another room until the evening, nothing at all. I've never ever experienced worse staff attitude than in this hotel. Total unprofessional attitude. This was the 3rd time I stayed here and up until now everything was great, one of the top hotels. After this experience though, I'll never ever come back.

-staff at the the breakfast very nice too, but the breakfast is overpriced in my opinion(48SGD) especially only 1kind of ham and not very tasty, for less money you can get much more at other hotels of the same category around the world

Capella Singapore,"This has to be one of the most horrible five star experiences in my life and the setting can't make up for it.
Several times called for a buggy to go back from visiting friends staying in a villa ( I was in a room in the main building) when I would call for a buggy to go back to my own room they would call to say it had arrived, but when I went up it was not there!  I was left standing in pitch dark and humidity! This didn't just happen once.
When I asked for the buggy to come to my room to go to the villas I was told to take the buggy from the lobby?! The lobby was also a long walk. Why couldn't they send the buggy to my room??
When I checked in, I was taken on a long walk outdoors to my room, when I finally reached my room I asked was there not a way to reach the room indoors! I had arrived from dubai and had been in Tokyo before that, both pretty hot but the Singaporean climate with its humidity is the most intolerable and they should know that a guest off a flight does not want to face it straight away!
Room service takes hours not minutes.
Collection of trays takes a ridiculous amount of time.
Empty shower gel and shampoo bottles were just left as they were by housekeeping, pretty disgusting.
When room service would deliver my orders they would just throw the items on the coffee table messily around the room. The items on the coffee table were a fruit basket and magazines both provided by the hotel. Can't they at least train them to move their own clutter in a decent manner?
The supposed Pratesi linens on my bed are creased and I haven't used the bed yet.
The curtains are not blackout. Yet for some reason they're motorised. Pointless, get some blackout first it's cheaper.
A vtech phone? Am I a kid again?
The Bluetooth on the audio system doesn't work.
The hotel is infested with insects.
I just came from the St Regis Dubai and before that the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo. This hotel needs serious help. I have been complaining to them, they respond ok, I say no it's not ok.. they don't offer any solution. Please beware, the high price doesn't mean you're getting quality at all.

Capella Singapore,"I planned a staycation to surprise my boyfriend as one my friend recommended this hotel to get away from the city in Singapore. I also wanted to check out the hotel and see if it is a great location for our friends engagement and proposal. Upon arriving the hotel, no one greeted me at the entrance, I had to find my way to the check in desk. The gentleman at the check in desk told me I have been upgrade to their service apartment --- hmmm I booked for a hotel room not a service apartment.. Hardly an upgrade in my opinion. I insisted on the hotel room but he told me it won't be ready till after 3? Excuse me? After 3? The actual fact is I didn't get my key till almost 4 and I had to Follow up with their staff multiple times during that time. not a 5 star service or efficiency.  Totally ruined my surprise for my boyfriend. Since he arrived before the key did! 

During my long wait for my room key at cassia, I was greeted with dirty floor under my table. (You can see in the picture attached ) For a 'fine dinning' restaurant... That's HIGHLY unacceptable!

Capella Singapore,"The worst 5-star hotel I've ever been!
I booked a one-bedroom villa for 3 nights thinking to spend quality time with my kids. When we reached hotel, they ""upgraded"" us to a room which faces the sea. I declined the offer as I don't need the sea view with young kids but the plunge pool that comes with a villa.  That's the reason why I booked a villa!  The hotel was unable to give me my villa as they were overbooked! Finally with all back and forth I had to stay in the room for one night before I could move to my villa. I can't believe the hotel can be so inconsiderate -  a villa can't be upgraded to a room as they are totally different serving different needs esp without me agreeing !!!  

To make it worse, my luggage went missing when I finally got to my villa. I had to scream before my luggage was delivered. Buggy service to and from villa has long wait like 20 min. Lights and curtains in living room didn't function properly...

Capella Singapore,"While Chef David is undoubtedly a Master, on Mother' s day it was perhaps  the worst choice.  

Reservations staff were really very helpful. .. but actual service staff on the day were worse than as absent. Absolutely horrible. 

There were three different high teas going on and it was confusing to understand why we were offered different tea choices to others. 

Crepes themselves were indeed good. .. and we were offered more than two, which was a pleasant surprise after we were informed that the tea came with only two small crepes .. but the wait of 20 minutes between crepes was insane. And at $45 for a cup of tea and 2 (albeit good) crepes, this was a very poorly priced offering. 

Luckily we were seated indoors because outside, despite large ceiling fans, they were left idle... leaving no movement of air.

Capella Singapore,"Sorry for this rant, I don’t mean to offend this hotel, but I felt that I have to air this. Needless to mention, this hotel is a top class and high standing. I attended wedding luncheon on Saturday at their Ballroom, and I was utterly shock and disgusted by the standard of hygiene, which rarely happen in any restaurant or eating places in Singapore, I believe it’s almost nonexistent. Being a Singaporean I must say that incident of this nature has not happened to me before. 

Realizing that my chopsticks was accidentally used by someone sitting next to me. I went over and asked a waitress for a new pair of chopsticks. She turned over to where the utensils are and there was a lone pair of black chopsticks among the forks and spoons half covered by a piece of cloth. The lone pair of chopsticks was on the side and on top of the cloth. She grasps the chopsticks and passed it to me. Because by the nature of the chopsticks placement, I got this intuition that the chopsticks wasn't new. True enough after touching the chopsticks because of my suspicion, there are tiny dried food that was stuck on the narrow tip of the chopsticks where foods are picked up. Maybe it has been used by a guest before. I told her that the chopsticks weren’t new and that I want new chopsticks. She replied and insisted it was new. I returned the chopsticks she gave me.

So I turned to a guy that looks like a supervisor to me and asked for a new pair of chopsticks. He went out of the ballroom and came back with a pair of chopsticks that is smooth from the top till the tip of it, which anybody can tell that it is new.

What was there for me to say? How can this happened, it could easy ruined the reputation of this top notch hotel? These kinds of things are the basics of Food and Beverages Industry.

Capella Singapore,"We are a family of four with a boy on the autism spectrum. We were so impressed with capella during our last stay that we decided to come back again. This is our third stay. This stay was a total letdown and we felt so unwelcome and disappointed. Capella prides itself on its PA system and promises a customized stay. Well, none of that happened. 

Last year, upon entering the villa, we were greeted by a personalized hand written card from the GM, bottle of red wine to thank us for repeat visit ( we left it untouched as we are not into wine) , cookies for the children with their names on the plates. Amenities were set up for 4 persons. Most important of all, my bucket list was met. We felt so welcome and well taken care of. We could simply retreat into our little oasis and enjoy our stay.
 However, I got a rude shock for this stay. It's fine that there were no gestures of personal touch. The absence of basic amenities for my children was a huge disappointment .looks like the new GM certainly dislike kids. Not a single item on my bucket list was fulfilled. The whole villa felt so cold and uninviting. Now my bucket list are just some items which can easily be put together by housekeeping within 10mins. I just wanted contour pillows, lots of towels, more drinking water, a bucket n a scoop to bathe my son as they do not have handheld shower. This bucket and scoop thing was a great idea suggested by the PA from the previous stay. Where is that customized stay promised by capella? I made a call to the PA to express my unhappiness. Well, she rectified it by sending me an ice bucket , some towels, 2 more toothbrushes and 2 kid size bathrobes. I was told that my preferences were stored in their system from the first stay. Maybe she didn't bother to finish reading my bucket list. I made a trip to the front desk, asking for the manager. She's not in but a gentleman there promised to make things right.  My bucket list finally got fulfilled. But damage had already been done and I was feeling damn sore. Kudos to the manager for trying to do some service recovery. I acknowledged her efforts but am really disappointed . I turned down her offers of meal and spa. No amount of meals or spa can soothe our disappointment . We are not unreasonable people. We do not need to be treated like VIPs. We just want capella to deliver its promises. We have high expectations from capella due to our past experiences and grandeur claims they advertised on their website. 
 We got another nasty surprise the next day. The house keeping did a wonderful fantastic job in cleaning  up the villa. But they took away my son's security blanket. Now any parent with an object obsession autistic child will know that spells big trouble, especially for bedtimes. This time I did not flare up. I gave the manager a call and ask her to get her staff to find the blanket back. I smiled to the housekeeper who came by and told him to take his time as I am going home to get another replacement.  When you have no expectations, there will be no disappointment.
They did find the blanket eventually.
I had come to accept that there are certain hotels that will give you lots of empty promises and when the one on top does not pride himself in doing things right, what can I expect from his subordinates.
Last year, capella had a GM who took great pride in his job and displays extreme hospitality. One who made his guests feel welcome and even touched my son's heart.

Capella Singapore,"Having heard excellent reviews about the service and facilities, I made reservations for a two-night stay in a one bedroom villa over a weekend in April. Our stay turned out to be an absolute nightmare, no thanks to treatment from the management that can only be described as downright disgraceful and unbecoming of an establishment that represents itself as a five star establishment and a member of the Leading Hotels of the World group.
 
We were celebrating a birthday that weekend, had invited more friends over the first night, and had consequently brought our own bottles of wine with us. We unloaded our baggage at the hotel lobby (ostensibly so that we could park the car, and have the hotel staff assist us with bringing our baggage directly to the room). After check-in, we were escorted to our villa on a buggy. On the ride over, I was informed by the member of the hotel staff driving the buggy that she noted that we had brought alcohol with us, and in accordance with hotel policy, we would be charged corkage (S$30 a bottle) for every bottle of alcohol we had with us, regardless whether it would actually be consumed.
 
We chose not to ruin the occasion, and agreed to pay the corkage bill. Notwithstanding this, the staff member who showed us to our villa was sullen throughout the rest of the ride, and throughout her “introduction” of the room and its amenities. And in spite of us having acknowledged their policy on corkage charges, and agreeing to pay the charges, she proceeded to ask twice more whether we were prepared to pay. That was not to be the end of it. After she had left, an hour’s worth of telephone calls back and forth between the hotel staff ensued.
 
The hotel’s position repeatedly changed during the course of the calls – the first few calls related to ascertaining the precise number of bottles of alcohol we had with us, and determining what would be the total corkage charge. Given that our baggage had yet to be delivered to our villa, this pointed towards the hotel staff having gone through all of our belongings, without our permission, to take stock of what we had brought with us!
 
Just as we got off the phone with room service, the phone rang again, and this time, the manager of the hotel had apparently decided she wanted to speak with us. We were told, very rudely, and arrogantly, that this was a five star establishment, where gatherings or parties of any kind were forbidden, and that if we should have read the terms and conditions prior to making our reservations, and should have chosen a different venue instead.
 
The clincher came when the manager informed us that in light of the hotel policy (notwithstanding the earlier agreement that we would simply foot the corkage bill), they would be retaining all our alcohol in the luggage room, and we would be allowed to reclaim them only at check out!
 
This is preposterous! First the hotel takes it upon itself to rummage through our belongings without our permission, then, it unilaterally determines that it has the right to essentially retain belongings and hold them until a time they deem acceptable?
 
It was only after further arguments with the manager that we were allowed to move the alcohol back to the car, and of course under the careful watch of two hotel staff.
 
By the time the issue had been resolved, and our baggage delivered to our villa (mind you, the entire time that the negotiations about the consumption of alcohol had been going on, the hotel had also decided that the rest of our baggage had to be withheld as well), it was well more than two hours after we had checked in. Needless to say, the rest of the day, and the rest of the stay was completely ruined.
 
Quite apparently, the Capella feels it is appropriate to speak to and treat paying guests like school children, or has decided that it has the same rights as customs and immigrations authorities and is entitled to exercise its discretion to search and retain personal belongings at their whim and fancy.
 
Whilst I acknowledge that parties of any kind are in general frowned upon and not allowed as a matter of hotel policy, the hotel staff I have encountered in the past have never felt the need to highlight this in such a rude manner. And whilst I assume that such an aversion towards parties at the Capella might have been borne out of prior bad experiences, it should never warrant talking down to and admonishing a paying guest for, may I add, an event that had yet to even occur.
 
My friends and I have lived and stayed at five star establishments worldwide, but never have we encountered service of the nature dished out by the Capella. It makes no apologies for its hardline policies, and its service staff is quite clearly ill-trained in the hospitality field. One does not pay S$1,000 a night to be talked down to and treated like an ill-educated immigrant. I should also add the pool area was poorly maintained - there was actually trash in the pool (empty plastic bottles) when we checked in, which turned us all of even using it at all.
 
Neither I nor any of my friends will be returning, and trust us, we have made sure that our experience has been retold countless times. I have personally always believed that it is the quality of the service that makes a hotel. No extent of beautiful surroundings can undo terrible service. The Capella does not deserve the accolades it has received, and its service standards are due for a major overhaul.",tripadvisor.com.sg,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Check-In & Check-Out Process"", ""categories""=>[""Poor service"", ""Surprise charges or billing mistakes""]}, {""theme""=>""Staff & Service Quality"", ""categories""=>[""Rude, inattentive, or unhelpful staff"", ""Poor problem resolution (slow or dismissive responses)"", ""Over-promising but under-delivering on \""luxury\"" standards""]}, {""theme""=>""Facilities & Infrastructure"", ""categories""=>[""Pool, spa, gym not functioning or poorly maintained""]}, {""theme""=>""Security & Privacy"", ""categories""=>[""Mishandling of guest belongings (lost luggage, theft)"", ""Privacy breaches (noise from staff, unannounced entry)""]}, {""theme""=>""Value-for-Money"", ""categories""=>[""Guests feeling the experience didn't justify the high price"", ""Hidden charges / unexpected fees""]}]}"
Capella Singapore,"Capella is celebrating their 1 year anniversary in March and supposedly has promotions for those who are also celebrating their birthdays and staying with them.

I called up the reservations department twice, once in the morning and later in the afternoon (as I needed to confirm their lousy attitude over the phone).  Both times I spoke with a female staff though I'm not sure if they were the same person. 

I wanted to ask about the rates and special package for 1 night stay for my birthday celebration and I asked when my guests will have to leave the place before the night, the female staff brusquely asked how many guests I will have and I told her ""2 or 3 guests"". She curtly said that ""guests are not allowed in the room as the room is fully furnished and the rooms do not have space for guests as the rooms are for accomodation only and that other hotel guests cannot be disturbed by noise. 

This fully irked me as first of all, she assumes that my guests will cause disturbance and secondly, she insults common sense by saying that a room cannot accomodate guests as the space in the room has been taken up by the furnishings.

I expected better service from a so-called luxury resort charging double the rates of other Sentosa hotels in the same tier, such as the Amara Sanctuary and the Sentosa Resort.

Capella Singapore,"We are extremely disappointed with the quality of service we received at Capella during our stay from 25th December 2009 to 28th December 2009.  This was supposed to be a romantic getaway at a 6-star resort .  However, several service issues emerged during our stay and had ruined a carefully planned and highly anticipated getaway.  We want to highlight these issues to other TripAdvisor users so that they can be aware of the poor quality of a supposedly 6 star hotel:

a)       Quality of Villa’s Finishing: There were some very major issues with the finishing of the villa:  

I.      Villa no. 36 had a leak in the roof.  After heavy rain, the side of the bed nearer to the bathroom was always flooded with a large pool of rainwater.  We had to call housekeeping to clean up the water for us, while we left the villa (instead of enjoying ourselves in the villa)
II.      The ground just outside the entrance of the villa is also not done properly – for the 4 days we were staying at the villa, there was a huge puddle of rainwater collected there, making it difficult to walk – we don’t see any puddle outside any other villas
III.      The room walls are quite thin and we could hear people walking past the villa. This is very irksome, especially early in the morning when the guests shuffle their way to the pool or the knoll past the villa.
IV.      The glass doors of the shower room and the toilet are not done properly and tend to slam themselves shut against the wall rapidly and loudly, giving us a fright every time we use the shower or the toilet
V.      There is also no DVD player in the living room of the villa – making it difficult if we want to watch movies in the day

b)       Quality of Housekeeping: While the staff are no doubt very friendly, there were serious issues with their ability to keep the villa clean and comfortable:  

I.      There were several dead cockroaches in the villa…. We had to remove them ourselves as the staff did not remove it during the night turndown service or the morning housekeeping service
II.      The outdoor tub was dirty throughout the 4 days we were there.  No one bothered to clean the tub at all
III.      The minibar was also not replenished for one of the nights
IV.      There was no newspaper on one of the days

 c)       Quality of Service: One of Capella's strengths is the friendliness of the staff and their willingness to go above and beyond to help when they can.  My wife’s gym shoes came apart and the staff at the front office were very helpful and gotten us super glue to fix her shoes from the convenience store nearby when there were none available in the resort.  Having said that, there is significant room for improvement:  
I.      While our package includes both breakfast and dinner, according to the email that was sent out to us to confirm our booking, no one in the resort could help us clarify what it entails.  We asked the Knolls and were redirected to the front office and when we called the front office, they directed us to the Knolls.  It was only on the final day of our stay that someone at the Front Office finally solved the mystery and mention that we only get one night of dinner at the Knolls for every two nights stay.   Even though the booking confirmation indicated that dinner was included, we decided not to argue as your staff began to dig out documentations and emails to show that it was only included for one night.   They were very defensive and there was no attempt to investigate or explain further and in a bid not to ruin our romantic getaway further, we decided to drop it and stop the discussion there and then
II.      We tried to get the personal assistant to help us on various issues, but were never able to get them successfully.  In the end, whenever we need help, we had to go to the front office. So much for 6 star service
III.      The staff at the Knolls was also not knowledgeable or not well trained – they did not advise us that we can order from the ala carte menu for the breakfast buffet and never able to answer any questions.  They also did not get back to us even though they said they would find out and revert.  The front office and the staff at Knolls also have a knack of bouncing questions to one another – when we called the Knolls, they transferred our call to the front office, who transferred us back to the Knolls with no resolution to our questions.
IV.      The buggy service is also very tardy.  It took them 25 minutes to pick us up from our villa on our day of checkout
 V.      Things seem to be running out in the resort – again this could be due to the holiday crowd, but the Knolls went out of orange juice on one day and watermelon juice on another.  Room service also ran out of Prime Angus burgers – and it took them 20 minutes to inform us that they were out
VI.      We reflected some of these issues to the staff when we were checking out and they promised that they will get back to us.  It’s been 4 weeks – we have not heard from them at all.  We forwarded the email to the General Manager of the resort - again no response

d)       Maintenance of the exterior (gardens, pathways, gym, pool etc): There are some issues with the maintenance of the exterior of the gardens and paths.  This could be due to the fact that the newness of the hotel, but still compromised the quality of our experience:  
I.      For the four days we were walking from the villa to the Knolls or the swimming pools, one of the pathways was perpetually covered with a thick layer of mud – probably due to the rain
II.      There was also a huge pool of mud on the grass patch next to one of the villas (we believe it is 51), and the buggies keep reversing into the patch, tracking a lot of mud onto the pathway, making it a relatively unpleasant sight
III.      The cleanliness of the pool also leaves a lot to be desired.  There were actually half eaten apples floating in one of the swimming pools while we were swimming.  This is likely due to the number of guests staying in the resort over the holiday weekend, but the inability to clean the pool out is unacceptable.  Imagine enjoying yourselves swimming with a rare moment of sunshine during the rainy season, only to be surprised by several half-eaten fruits that had turned brown floating in the pool
IV.      TV on several gym equipments were not working for the 4 days that we were there.  There were also no one in the gym to help with the headphones and we had to change the covers and sanitize the headphones ourselves

In the end, the experience was so frustrating that we checked out at ~ 1220 pm – rather than staying a few hours longer to enjoy the amenities – This was a first for us when visiting resort, leaving early even though our late checkout request was approved.  If not for the buggy taking 25 minutes to come, we would have checked out earlier than 12pm.

I doubt we will ever return to any Capella resorts and would advise anyone who is planning a romantic trip to Capella to think twice!

St. Regis Singapore,"Except for the very gentlemanly concierge doormen and the chef who greeted the guests in the breakfast room, the service of other service staff is worse than that of Courtyard and Fairfield Inn in many countries. The so-called butler service of St. Regis, I didn't see the figure of this ""butler"" from beginning to end during my three-day stay. I don't know what my butler is called. The black tea brewed with tea bags provided by the butler has to be paid after noon. If this service is the standard of St. Regis, it is too embarrassing for Marriott. My family lives in the most basic room. The child wants to take a nap for an hour because of airsickness. The hotel does not allow delayed check-out until 1 pm, even though all the rooms around are vacant. It is recommended that the management of this hotel go to St. Regis Changsha, China and St. Regis New York, USA to learn how to provide good butler service and how to develop a proactive service mindset. Your so-called ""butler"" is not as enthusiastic and professional as the doormen in the concierge!

St. Regis Singapore,"Fresh off my stay in another St Regis property in another country, and after experiencing the wonderful service there I have decided to go ahead and booked this stay at my home country and was really looking forward to it.
Unfortunately, my stay here was a far cry from my stay at other St Regis properties.

Let's go over the good points first, room was clean and nicely decorated of a 5 stay hotel. Food was great too.

Now unto the bad ones, which is mainly the service.
1) Firstly, I drove over and wanted to drop my belongings at the pick up point, but all the staff at the lobby ignored me as they probably thought I was the Grab driver!! I had a call for help like a spoilt child... very unwelcoming and embarrassing start to my stay.

2) As a gold member, I was gifted a complimentary benefit which they did not present to me during my check in initially and only after coming back after enquiring about something. So that would have been 'conveniently missed' if I had not came back?

3) After enjoying the benefit, I was then 'conveniently charged' with the bill!! And this was after clarifying with 2 check in staff, and another staff at the restaurant it was complimentary.
Somehow, the staff handling the bill (which I assume just started his shift) was kept out of picture! What pisses me off is that he wasn't even apologetic about it and gave me the look like I can't afford to pay. Even tried to argue with me!! very uncomfortable.

4) My accompanying guest, who needed to top up his cashcard to exit, found that the cashcard machine was faulty. Now he is stuck in the carpark with his child and in a hurry to get to his next appointment. Approached the front desk for help and they just tell him off nonchalantly to just walk over about 5-10 minutes 1 way to top up (because of a fault in your facility he had to walk over as a guest, are you sure??! ). I am sure a 3 star hotel can do better.
Asked again and they said it is not their fault and there is nothing they can do. Finally, he had to demand to be allowed to exit as a Platinum guest staying in the hotel! Left the carpark with a bad taste.

Way to go to piss off your Platinum member on the way out.

5) Now it came to my turn to exit the carpark later in the day. As I recalled reading the terms and conditions that carpark coupons are only valid for the day itself, I specifically asked the front desk staff during my check out if I needed another parking coupon to exit. But since I did not use mine the day before, the staff assured me the same parking coupon can be used for the day, and another parking coupon is not required.

Turns out I was correct! I could not exit the carpark and needed another carpark coupon when I tried to exit later in the day. Imagine your guest knowing more about the rules and regulations more than you! Even got into an argument with the rude intercoms lady as she insisted I was at fault for trying to use an expired ticket. 'Well done', now I am getting blamed for the misinformation from your very own front desk. Left the carpark with a bad taste.

Way to go to piss off your Gold member on the way out.

Concluding Remarks:
The entire stay comes off as extremely uncoordinated, seems like the staff at various departments do not communicate with each other. Guests have to repeatedly ask for things and even make demand for basic things which is very unbecoming for a hotel of this caliber. Staff are also very insensitive and dismissive of requests, giving the impression they just want you to go away.

St. Regis Singapore,"Our recent stay at St. Regis Singapore was unfortunately underwhelming and far from the luxury we had anticipated.

Upon entering our room, hints of luxury were overshadowed by signs of wear and tear. The furnishings looked tired, the lights flickered both in the bedroom and bathroom, and the TV was slanted and precariously close to falling off the wall. 

Check-in was painfully slow, our room request made prior to the stay was overlooked, and the front desk staff seemed unsure of basic procedures. Directions to the guest room lift weren’t provided, and no one walked us to the lift, which is an expected courtesy at a hotel of this caliber.

Dinner at Astor Grill was another disappointment. The restaurant was nearly empty, but when we requested a specific table, we were initially told it was reserved. After pushing further, another staff member promptly seated us there—why the resistance in the first place? Later, when we asked for a phone charger, we were told the restaurant had none, only for the staff to later admit they did, in fact, have a charger. The inconsistent and unhelpful service was frustrating.

A visit to the pool and spa revealed even more issues. A pool attendant begrudgingly told us we could use the jacuzzi at the spa when we asked if there was one as the pool was rather cold (belatedly, as we did not had this information at the front desk, the guest letter, nor the pool when we visited earlier in the day). When we went to the spa around 8:15pm, we were initially denied access to the jacuzzi, with the staff claiming the spa was fully booked. Yet, when we went in, the spa was completely empty. After pointing this out, we were reluctantly allowed to use the jacuzzi, but only for a limited time until 8:50pm, which we were okay with. It was clear the staff wanted to leave on time but denying usage 45 minutes prior to closure is very unreasonable. When we pressed further and asked where are the guests since they mentioned the facility is fully booked, they told us the guests were receiving treatment in the treatment rooms now. But in fact, the treatment rooms were unoccupied (we found out as we stumbled into the treatment area with all doors open and no one in sight)—a blatant lie meant to deny usage and rush us out.

We went to Astor Bar and had a couple of drinks before calling it a night. 

The following morning, our request for a late checkout was met with unnecessary resistance. As Gold Elite members, we expected more flexibility, but it took multiple requests to finally secure a 2 pm checkout. It felt like we were constantly fighting for basic service at every turn.

Checkout was another frustration. We were not shown the bill and had to ask for one. Even when we asked, we were repeatedly told they will mail it to us. Why can’t they show it to us on the spot? Were we not supposed to check the bill? When the checkout procedures were done, there was no “thank you for staying with us” or even a simple question about how our stay was. We awkwardly left when we realized there would be no further interaction or farewell—odd behavior for a luxury hotel.

In summary, our experience at St. Regis Singapore was marked by disappointing service and an overall lack of the luxury and attentiveness you would expect from a hotel of this standing. Despite our willingness to pay more and our loyalty status, the hotel’s service fell far short of expectations.",tripadvisor.com.sg,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Reservation & Pre-Arrival"", ""categories""=>[""Booking Error""]}, {""theme""=>""Check-In & Check-Out Process"", ""categories""=>[""Long Wait"", ""Poor service"", ""Surprise charges or billing mistakes""]}, {""theme""=>""Room Assignment & Condition"", ""categories""=>[""Wrong room allocation (e.g., not the one booked)"", ""Maintenance issues (broken AC, shower, TV, etc.)"", ""Outdated or worn-out furnishings""]}, {""theme""=>""Staff & Service Quality"", ""categories""=>[""Rude, inattentive, or unhelpful staff"", ""Poor problem resolution (slow or dismissive responses)"", ""Over-promising but under-delivering on \""luxury\"" standards""]}, {""theme""=>""Food & Beverage Experience"", ""categories""=>[""Long wait times for in-room dining or restaurants""]}, {""theme""=>""Facilities & Infrastructure"", ""categories""=>[""Pool, spa, gym not functioning or poorly maintained""]}, {""theme""=>""Value-for-Money"", ""categories""=>[""Guests feeling the experience didn't justify the high price""]}]}"

They claimed it wasn't them and it must have happened before i gave the clothes to laundry because 'they have experience.

St. Regis Singapore,"The charm of this beautiful Marriott Bonvoy grew faint with the extremely unsatisfying service for my 1.5 year old daughter. I was highly recommended St. Regis by my elder brother for hospitality and service while travelling with family, however, it turned out to be one of our worst nightmares. I even dropped a food request email to the hotel prior to our stay.

We were there for 3 nights, and they could only serve us Porridge for our daughter, for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And when suggested to connect with a chef so I could request proper food for her, there were only empty promises. We were even sent the invoice for the baby food, which has never been the case across the Globally recognized Marriott Properties. 

If it were not for the hot plate that I carried from India, along with some roasted grains, my child would have gone hungry at the hotel. This was really unsettling. 

The breakfast buffet team, was extremely mismanaged, with no one knowing the order for the table and 5 waiters bringing me more of the same dish I requested one portion of. No one was bothered if the extra food cooked was going to the trash. 

I would really not recommend St. Regis as a family stay hotel to anyone in my connection, it really was the worst start to our 5 day long vacation in Singapore.",tripadvisor.com.sg,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Staff & Service Quality"", ""categories""=>[""Poor problem resolution (slow or dismissive responses)"", ""Over-promising but under-delivering on \""luxury\"" standards""]}, {""theme""=>""Food & Beverage Experience"", ""categories""=>[""Limited menu choices vs. premium expectations""]}, {""theme""=>""Value-for-Money"", ""categories""=>[""Guests feeling the experience didn't justify the high price"", ""Hidden charges / unexpected fees""]}]}"

St. Regis Singapore,"Unfortunately, my family and I were not lucky enough to return to this hotel for the second time and stay there for two nights from 01/19/24 to 01/21/24. It all started when we were given a room in which the air conditioner was constantly running at 21 degrees Celsius and could not be adjusted, that is, it was impossible to raise the temperature and it was impossible to turn it off.(
The waiters in the restaurants and the staff at the pool behave like millionaires who apparently often visit this hotel and they have seen enough of them and copy them.
The worst thing in our situation was the transfer to the airport. I decided to order it through the concierge who spoke little English. She promised us an Alphard Toyota at a price agreed upon with her, which is higher than the price of a regular taxi and asked about the method of payment, I replied that payment would be by credit card. After 10 minutes, we headed to the airport and then, when checking our luggage, we discovered that we had not been given a bag, after which we returned for it and continued the trip fully equipped. During the trip, the driver handed us his mobile phone and explained in poor English that in the mobile application you need to enter all the credit card data, including the svc code, which is very dangerous for your credit card and its contents because where will your data end up later? does not know . Naturally, I refused to do what. We stopped in front of an ATM; when we tried to withdraw money, nothing worked because not all ATMs service the bank where I have a current account. After that, we arrived at the airport, unloaded our luggage and I suggested to the driver that he send me a payment link by email and I could pay for the trip from my mobile phone, to which I heard a scream roughly comparable to how they scream at the zoo and a refusal to fulfill this request. His heart-rending scream attracted the attention of passers-by; it was clear that not everything was fine with his nervous system. Having seen this picture, with thoughts of protecting my family, I went to look for an ATM at a large airport. I found an ATM that works with our bank and withdrew cash. Returning back, I saw that the leader called the police, after talking with them, they realized who exactly was to blame for this situation, they offered to leave me comments and reviews on this situation to the hotel that had previously provided such a “level” of service and the organization from which this inadequate mental structure was a person who allows himself to raise his voice at the customer and not meet him halfway in case of stupidity and poor English as a consequence.
After all, it was very easy to send me a link to my email and I could pay for the trip from MY mobile phone.
The whole mood about the trip, about the city, about the people was ruined by one inadequate driver.
How the level of the St. Regis in Singapore has fallen in our eyes!

St. Regis Singapore,"Having not travelled for some 6 years we were so looking forward to returning to a favourite hotel in Singapore but were left feeling so disgusted that instead of the planned 10 night stay we left after just 1 terrible night. 
The room allocated to me on check-in was a standard room and after enquiring about a possible upgrade due to my lifetime Titanium status, I was informed that the hotel was full. Fair enough, but after expressing our disappointment at this news, the check-in staff member disappeared out the back and came back to say that another room was available (???). This room was the next level up. I asked whether there were any suites available for an upgrade and she stated that there were no suites available at all. I asked her to confirm that there were absolutely NO SUITES available, and she confirmed. We accepted the (slight) upgrade and made our way to this room.
 Upon entering we were hit with a disgusting smell of mould. We were hovering at the doorway when the Bell Man arrived at our door. He asked if there was a problem, and we mentioned the smell. He concurred and immediately left us to go back downstairs to sort something out. He eventually arrived back with room keys, ironically to the original room.... We duly made our way to this room only to find that it was absolutely filthy with shocking stains on the carpets, and every surface scratched. (We would later find that the shower did not drain and in fact the next morning the entire bathroom flooded - we could not even use the toilet). The Bell Man again agreed that the room was not acceptable and asked if I would speak to the DM. 
While waiting for this call, I googled the hotel only to find that there was a suite available, albeit a specialty suite. The DM eventually called and told me that there were no other room types available. When I mentioned that I had found the specialty suite on-line to be available she told me that this was a glitch and that the room was not available. 
I fully understand that an upgrade is not guaranteed. The point was that there was a suite available and while I “get” that the hotel is under no obligation to offer that to me, the mere fact that the room was so disgusting might in fact mean that as a gesture of goodwill I may have been offered the use of that room for the night – quite apart from the fact that I was lied to by both the customer agent and the Duty Manager.
The only saving grace was the terrific service we received the next morning at breakfast, but unfortunately the damage was done, and we checked out and moved to another hotel.
Once we returned home, I contacted the customer care team via Marriott Bonvoy and requested I be contacted by the General Manager of the hotel. This did not occur even after several emails.

St. Regis Singapore,"A bad experience, far worse than any St. Regis on the planet! All employees are extremely lazy, charging arbitrary amounts, and making mistakes over and over again! Including GM Allen Howden completely ignored it!!!!!
It’s just rubbish!

I actually received an email today, telling me that there was $27 in banknotes that I had not collected for my stay more than a month ago, and now I am being charged!

It’s so stupid! When I checked out, I had all the receipts, and everything I checked was fine, but now I suddenly received an amount from an unknown source!

It’s simply unreasonable!

Why do I check so carefully line by line when I check out? It's because more than a month ago, I stayed for four consecutive nights, and on the second night, they suddenly charged me more than 70 Singaporean paper! I rushed down to reception late at night!

Then something even more ridiculous happened. There was only one intern at the reception late at night. I told the intern that if you can't handle it, call the manager on duty to come out!

After three reminders and four invitations, the intern went back and forth to the front desk and back desk several times. The manager on duty actually chose to avoid it, immediately refunded the Singaporean paper of more than 70 yuan, and then asked the intern to deal with it and said it was a system problem! After I receive the refund, will there be any problems if I check with the intern again and again? After I leave Singapore, will they suddenly charge me money again? The intern kept apologizing and confirmed that there would be no further system fees! Sure enough, today, more than a month later, there is another problem!

I will then ask an intern to give me the name of the manager on duty for the next day, and I will complain the next day! This is even more powerful! There was a day shift manager named Candy who was completely missing! ! But then I found out that the GM of St. Regis Singapore, Allen Howden, also didn’t reply to emails and just ignored me! ! I started to understand how this hotel can be so ridiculously bad! !

There is a huge gap between this hotel and St. Regis in other areas, and the service level is completely unmatched!

When calling for service in the room, such as asking for multiple towels, wait for at least an hour. You must call at least twice every time. The service will be delivered first!

St. Regis Singapore,"its a shylokian and Heartless hotel
This is one of the most heartless hotel i have visited where they treat their ""Guests"" as objects. Absolutely contrary to their moto, the Innkeepers at the St Regis Singapore have lost the fundamentals of ""Hospitality"". There are several reasons why one should choose plethora of hotel nearby and not the St Regis at Singapore: 

1) Its at a very uncomfortable distance. The minimum one way walk is about 1.1-1.2 Kms to reach anywhere. That distance is such that all modes of transport are uncomfortable (unless ofcourse you have a chauffer driven car at your disposal). The walk is enjoyable once but if you have to do it 2-3 times daily, it becomes a punishment. As you go towards the orchard road, several several choices open up and ""perhaps"" they might be little hospitable too! 

2) The hotel people are less than honest. We wrote twice to the General Manager explaining how we have been treated. The fellow did not even have the courtsey to either respond. As important as he must be, he heads the hotel an how his people treat their guests, that responsibility stops with him. If the head of the hotel doesnt even bother to respond, obviously no one else will. 

3) We made a 3 night award booking (Obviously travelled enough to accumulate these many points) and could have made 4 more nights at the same rate. With this much experience, one is able to make a distinction between honest and shyloks. We made a booking through the App. we checked in through the App. The app allocated a time and room for us. When we reached the hotel, they refused to honour the time and the room. We showed the app to the Front Office  and despite this, they kept on harpering some ""technical difficulties"" for which the room could not be made ready. 

As a hospitality Industry, one would expect a basic training to ensure that they would ensure some comfort to the guest. People travel from far and across. Not even water was offered. Some tea/coffee was part of room but was bluntly refused. The people are also not very pleasant to deal with. This and many more factors combined led u to believe that they are used to treating their people like chattels. Quite contrary to the advertised promise of the brand.  

4. We went to celebrate my birthday. a cake was booked for the midnight. Never came. When we wrote for the second time, some gentleman called up next morning citing ""Operational Difficulties"" in sending a cake and in lieu thereof, offered dinner! Again, no value of the fact that they come in a fiduciary duty towards people who travel from far and across. Once they choose to spoil someone's holiday, they spoil days of planning, travel and the stay. How can someone nonchalantly say ""Have dinner on us and forget everything"". There was a lot of arrogance even in that offer. This according to St Regis Singapore is the value of other humans

5. There were small small instances which we brought to the notice of the management as examples. BUt they all fell on deaf ears. They arent worthwhile repeating. Ultimately, each experience is different. 

I would like to believe that as big a name as it might be, to us, they robbed us of all the efforts we made. From flights to the hotel money (points in this case)  and to the invaluable loss of time because of them. Not one minute should be spent on hotels when anyone is on vacation. They charge to provide assistance , not to spoil days. 

This idea that they are some big shots who can behave arrogantly cannot run along with the word hospitality. 

For these reasons, we believe that St Regis Singapore doesnt deserve anyone's money.

Worst part was our room lock was spoilt and nothing was done for more than 3 hours. After determining that the lock could not be fixed on the spot, we had to wait nearly 2 hours to get a new room. Hotel was equally non-responsive upon receiving our feedback.

St. Regis Singapore,"Extremely irresponsible and dishonest over excess charges
I feel really sorry that I have to write this review as I have stayed at your amazing property multiple times and it has been nothing less than perfect before this extremely disappointing incident.

In March 2023, I was billed for 2 nights after a 1-night stay. Since then, I have called the hotel at least 5 times. Each time, I was assured that I would receive a refund of the overcharge in a few days. A week or two would fly by without me receiving anything and I would call for an update, only to have to repeat my entire story to a different member of the staff. 

It has been almost 6 weeks since the incident, and I have yet to get any response from any of the 5 different staff members that promised to follow up. At first, I convinced myself it could have been a one-off overlook, but it seems to me this is a systemic issue and that St Regis Singapore has no intention to return the excess charges. 

I am sure you will understand that I have exhausted my patience and options at this hopeless situation. Hence I will proceed with a police report and legal letter from here. 

Once again, I am sorry that my good memories at The St Regis has to end on such a disappointing note, and I hope no one else has to undergo the very unpleasant experience that I went through.",tripadvisor.com.sg,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Check-In & Check-Out Process"", ""categories""=>[""Surprise charges or billing mistakes""]}, {""theme""=>""Staff & Service Quality"", ""categories""=>[""Poor problem resolution (slow or dismissive responses)"", ""Over-promising but under-delivering on \""luxury\"" standards""]}, {""theme""=>""Value-for-Money"", ""categories""=>[""Hidden charges / unexpected fees""]}]}"
St. Regis Singapore,"Upon arrival, my wife and kids alighted from the car, as I was going to park the vehicle.  There were 2 porters at the entrance, and no one came forward to offer any assistance to my wife, who then had to carry our hand carry baggage to the front desk all by herself. Both of them saw my wife and the kids, and they saw my wife having to contend with the baggage while walking into the hotel, so it is not a matter that they did not know guests had arrived.  This is such a disappointing experience considering helping guests with their baggage is the most basic service one could expect from any hotel.

St. Regis Singapore,"Stayed at multiple St. Regis properties around the world, the stay at St. Regis Singapore was extremely disappointing.

First of all, I emailed the property a day before my stay for the simple arrangement and request but they never had the courtesy to acknowledge and follow up on the request. They do not even reply my email and of course none of the request was arranged during my stay. 

Next, the mobile apps Marriott Bonvoy do not works at all. I have mentioned the estimated time arrival around 1300hrs when I booked the room and also set to have the notification to be send to me when the room is ready. However I only received the text around 2215hrs on my check-in date.

On my check-in day, I reached in hotel with my boyfriend and this happened while we waiting for the lift. I understand that our stay was on weekend and might be a little busy for the guest services. However, I believed this is not a good reason for the bellboy to squeeze the luggage tray with us in the lift. When the lift reached our staying floor, he also did not have the awareness to stand aside and let us go out from the lift. 

And next thing which I totally cannot accept during the stay was St. Regis was being known for the 24 hours butler service, but sadly there was no welcome drinks upon our arrival which supposed to be delivered. I requested few bottles of mineral water through mobile apps, the reply was well noted and allowed them to have some time to send to my room. I wait for few hours and I received nothing. Then I called the butler service number however was met with an engaged tone. I tried to call concierge and so called the 24 hours in room dining for assistance, but guess what, no one pick up my call as well.

For a five stars hotel, I would say the hardware of the room was very disappointing and in need of refurbishment. First of all, very less tv channels for selection and lack of charging socket in the room. Besides, there was no bidet in the toilet and warmer for the toilet seat. The main board of the lights also cannot work effectively and took very long time when I want to dim the light in our room. And also this was the first time I met short circuit during staycation and I have to wait the technician to come and repair the damage light bulb.

I’ve stayed with St. Regis in few cities previously and I had good memories which caused me to book your hotel instead of other luxury hotels in Singapore. But I don’t think my experience will lead me to stay again with St. Regis as I truly disappointed with the services being provided. This is the first time for me to write a bad review and probably my worst experience for a staycation ever.

St. Regis Singapore,"I normally don’t like posting negative reviews. But I feel the need to share my recent experience with other travelers. 

I was double charged for a recent stay at the St. Regis Singapore. I ended up paying for the same stay using both cash and Marriott Bonvoy Points. 

While the double charge could have been easily corrected, what I found most egregious was the lack of response from the St. Regis Singapore. I called and emailed the property several times for well over a week asking for a simple status update. They never had the courtesy to acknowledge and follow up on the issue. Never did it cross their mind to send a simple “Thanks for bringing this matter to our attention. We are working to resolve it. Here are next steps.”

Communication is the first step to resolving any issue. Apparently the St. Regis Singapore can’t seem to get this basic concept straight. I am still waiting to have this issue resolved - nearly two weeks after I checked out! 

I am a Marriott Ambassador Elite member. I have stayed at hundreds of Marriott properties around the world over the years. This includes other St. Regis properties. Never before have I felt so insulted and disrespected with such cold indifference. I am truly shocked and disappointed.

St. Regis Singapore,"I stayed at st Regis with my friend for a post covid reunion and remembered st Regis as being old country English style elegant from before covid. 
Granted the last time I stayed there according to my husband was in 2017, but the st. Regis in Oct 2022 post covid was shockingly below par on all points!
First the room we stayed in was dated ...and by dated I mean really DATED! I actually felt my stress levels rise as I ventured into the bathroom...cleanliness was not the greatest and definitely not sth u think st Regis would compromise on.
So let me cut to the chase and share the negatives of our stay

1) Cleanliness of the bathroom was really QUESTIONABLE...I had to make sure my eyes did not venture to the small drain area in the shower ... subconsciously I realised I would be there for 3 whole nights and I had no desire to see what I'm very sure would be mould and algae in that area...I opted for the ignorance is bliss attitude

2) having decided that the 'ignorance would be bliss ' motto would be the best for that 3 night stay, no amount of embracing that tenet could make me IGNORE THE QUALITY of their towels!!! Yes! You read me right!!! The towels were SHOCKINGLY FRAYING at the edges!! And THIN!! Like u know they have been used for YEARS and not changed!! I must say we didn't know if we should be amused or appalled by the quality of their towels. Unfortunately I have since deleted the photos of the fraying towels after bringing it to the attention of the front desk...not that they did anything about it...we are due for a refurbishment next year was their excuse 

3) The hardware of the room was really quite shall we say in need of serious maintenance? First night of check in ...TV did NOT work...they had to send the technician in TWICE to get it working...
Then the phone to the reception seemed to have a mind of its own and worked when it WANTED to work.
Same with the WiFi according to my friend who had to work and got really frustrated with the frequent drop of WiFi in the room. Same thing with the table light...I think you need a certain degree in electrical engineering to turn the light off...it took some fiddling before we could get the light to turn on and off...

4) I 'injured' my leg on the side of the bed with a splinter from the chipped wood at the underside of the bed...luckily I was able to pluck the splinter out ... And a small bandaid was all I needed. Still that was an appalling experience in a what is touted as a 5 star hotel.

5) zero sign of the butler and while we normally don't even bother with the butler service , this stay was the one time when there were times we desperately pressed the butler button on the phone and was met with an engaged tone. I told my fren if memory serves a butler was on hand to show us the room the last time I stayed with st Regis pre covid.

6) zero turn down service by housekeeping and they collected a pile of rubbish which was OBVIOUSLY for throwing and left it on the coffee table... perhaps they want their guests to do a little bit of exercise and throw rubbish ourselves?

All in all st Regis Singapore not only spoiled it's brand name in Singapore but as my friend so succinctly put it...with so many luxury brand names to choose from the st Regis does not deserve a second chance.
I will be thinking VERY EXTREMELY hard if anyone ever suggests booking with the st Regis chain anywhere in the world!

All in all st Regis singapore not only spoiled their own brand name in Singapore for my friend and I, but they have also cast a HUGE cloud on the st Regis brand globally. We will definitely think not once not twice but THREE times before ever looking at the st Regis brand anywhere else.

St. Regis Singapore,"Used to be a regular for many many years and stopped coming due to the corporate management and your Status means zero I mean ZERO but was never like that beforE like 4-5 years ago but new management is horrible. We are titanium elite means zip. Our room this stay although asked for months ahead for upgrade of course based on availability but in old days when management was not so stuffy and horribly corporate we always got a suite. This stay worse room in the hotel by the elevator. Came back for last try for the Barings AGM conference I warned Barings top management about this tired property and regimented corporate management who hide behind desks and once in awhile if your lucky after a week or 10 days a duty manager will reply to an email you always get dirty out of the office reply. Now for the food? The conference was terrible but expected but they have  very nice restaurants in the hotel and ALL I MEAN ALL Don’t allow your status for discounts like we get 20 off everywhere in marriot properties but this one. Even the Japanese restaurant at 400.00 plus plus for 12 pieces of tempura. Now the platinum lounge, we walked out was so embarrassed along with our colleges your allowed one drink from a menu of three corny cheap drinks they don’t even allow you there signature drink and the appetizers that came 20 minutes later the pita was frozen and hard like a Rock I mean like a rock and nothing to drink so we all left. There butler service takes up to 15 minutes to answer the phone and rarely get your order right. Not even after all these years and we come to Singapore 5 times a year 9 days per stay not even a welcome back from front desk and asked for the manager or duty manager or supervisor on check in and got, sorry nobody around. The management puts the front desk people to do the dirty work and they have zero power. Oh for concierge????? For a 5 star hotel that they claim to be??????????? they do not have concierge any longer, one of so many cut backs. This tired property is a 3 plus star at best. We are booked from here at at regis Bali OMG night and day from this property than Osaka and these like most are real st regis properties with real management. We are big st regis fans and that’s our first pick when traveling and we spend 80 plus nights in hotels per year. Not only is this the worse property but worse st regis anywhere in the world. The management gets away with this so until the owners  wake up? It will never change and BTW we are also marriot hotel partners and never ever would we allow to leave incapable management to ruin our properties name not to mention marriot name. Even told them we are marriot partners not even that meant anything. So good luck staying here. Another one of our Funds was planning an event here thank god there reconsidering.

St. Regis Singapore,"Had a very poor stay for a week at the St. Regis Singapore.  The hotel has a lot of issues that it needs to address on all levels.
Check in was good with the bellman taking our luggage from the car and holding it till we were assigned our room.  He however did not escort us to the room, but that was ok and turned up with our luggage a few minutes after we were in the room.  However, he did not show us around the room, just put the luggage in their place and left.
The room was somewhat dated, though ok in general, but not really a true 5-star furnishings.  Maybe years ago, but not anymore.  The butler eventually showed up with some fruits and to ask if we wanted any coffee or tea (did not offer to unpack as they should).  That was the last we saw of him for a couple of days.  
We ordered room service to get some food, which turned out to be terribly oversalted and very small portions.  When we called to have the tray removed, it took forever to get someone to answer the phone which they did not do, and I finally had to put the cart outside myself to have it taken away.
The non-answering of phones by any staff is a norm a this so called 5-star hotel.  You can call anyone, butlers, concierge (whose desk I never even saw in the lobby) or the operator.  Its truly a hit and miss experience to get someone to pick up the phone on the other end.  And when finally, someone answers, they either do not get what you ask for properly, or just take forever to do it.  For example, we asked for an air purifier in the room.  The young man who spoke no English showed up with a humidifier, and when I tried to explain to him that this is not what I asked for, he had no clue what I was speaking of.  I sent him on his way with the humidifier accepting the fact either they do not know what I am speaking of, or they do not have one.  When I called the operator about it, they said they will look into it, but since we were tired, I said forget it for now.  Sure, enough they called the next day to let us know that the hotel does not have any air purifiers for the rooms.  So much for 5-star service.  I can get purifiers at other hotels no problem, wonder why I cannot do that here.
The next day we went for breakfast at Les Saveurs.  The food at the buffet is average at best, salty and not very exciting.  It took us a couple of days to find items we like to eat that did not contain all the salt.  Asking for coffee is another nightmare since it takes half hour or more to get a cup and the servers really have no clue what you are asking about.  Same for a glass of water.  The sous chef is walking around the entire breakfast area and does not know much about what types of food they really serve.  I have never seen a sous chef spending the entire mealtime walking around, and not be in the kitchen helping to cook the food.  Also, when he stands at your table and sees dirty dishes you think he would pick it up and take it away.  No, he does not do that, he lets the service staff do it when they get a chance which can be your entire meal. So, the so-called great buffet breakfast though plenty of options was not worth it.  And the items are the same every day no change at all what you can choose other than what they have on the menu or at the buffet table and all those items are the same every day.  Even a Hampton inn changes items daily.   We were going to try to have dinner at the restaurant as well but after the breakfast experience, we decided to skip the potential experience.
When I asked for laundry to be done, I clearly marked the ticket to have it back the same day, yet they had to call to verify that I wanted my laundry done the same day.  The day before we left, I had a couple of items to be laundered and the butler was surprised that I asked for same day service.  Note they charge double for express service which is absurd from a so called 5-star hotel.
We also had issues at the reception desk where the staff are constantly busy chatting with each other, and it seems and imposition on them to help the guests.

Overall, the best staff are the bellmen for their friendliness and the rest of the staff is either still asleep while working or have no idea what it means to be truly helping the guests.
We had the choice of this hotel, the 4 seasons and the Regent amongst others in the area and we chose the St. Regis.  Huge mistake.  I stayed at the Regent years ago and the service far exceeds what the St. Regis offers including the food, etc.

St. Regis Singapore,"Covid has made the Regis more like an Ibis.
What kind of hotel has a policy that treats guests like criminals when you have friends over.
We had a birthday party of about 10 pax. But when they delivered ice, started questioning us and said that only 2 guests are allowed.

The issue was, none of us were planning to stay over except for the bday boy.
Then came a series of knocks on the door as well as calls to harass everyone in the room to clear out at about 12am, all while treating the hotel guests like criminals for violating their highly policed ""no friends after 1030"" policy. 
In fact one of the staff AMY actually came out to antagonize us further at the main lobby. All whilst plainly repeating it's ""hotel policy"" that friends are not allowed post 1030pm. Despite trying to explain that we are not staying over, she kept on insisting the same with no further explanation. 

1. We did not make much noise in the room (despite what I believe the mgmt will claim). So the question is, Why is st Regis Singapore being more strict than the Singapore government? there is no such rule that restricts a gathering of friends post 1030. Is marriott running a Luxury hotel or an elderly retirement home? What purpose could this policy serve? 

2. As we were standing on the carpet outside with the St Regis insignia proudly emblazoned, the staff vacuuming told us ""excuse me"" and gestured for us to get off the carpet onto the tarmac so he can vacuum. Now, I have stayed in numerous Marriott properties across the globe and has never encountered such behavior from the staff. 
Of course, only at st regis Singapore. Whilst he did apologize upon realizing we were annoyed, the damage was done. 

As many others have pointed out here with similarly long barrage of words, it is quite evident that many guests are miffed enough to put all our dissatisfaction into words. That the service levels have deteriorated to such levels that we must say something.

St. Regis Singapore,"I actually booked months ago 10 nights at the St Regis Sjngapore I normally get upgraded as a Titanium Elite member to a suite it’s very very rare I do not. as it’s not easy to spend over 75 nights at one chain so I think that that’s well reserved.when I booked the reservation I also Spoke with other Singapore 5 star all saying no problem we will upgrade you allot do it on bookings done do it a week prior the rules are day of check in. this property does not value marriot status at all in any way shape or form
Used to stay at this property allot.

I played along with them for two months all the way to the end and finally God sorry there’s no way will be able to give you a sweet my bet is as I hear from all of my other business associates the travel Sjngapore no longer stay there either they never even tried. Furthermore I have emails going back-and-forth with 25 star properties with them saying that they look after both reservations when I questioned that and made a big deal of it it got dropped. I think the hotel manager is really really got his work cut out and if you want to get a response it will take 1 to 3 days because every time you emailed them back they’re out of the office for a day two days three days I’ll contact you when we’re back it seems like nobody’s working there. But I will say they do address both emails back so so sorry for the delay that’s on over 20 emails out of the 20+ that went back-and-forth I challenge the general manager to read them to see what’s going on more so talk to the staff he will know right then and there he’s got a big problem on his hands. I’m booked in sept for a conference there where the firm we invest with is having the event but I will probably cancel as well.

St. Regis Singapore,"Hi General Manager Radu, I am getting in touch to share multiple incidents that occurred during my recent stay at your hotel - there's much to be done so that the St Regis can continue to claim its 5-star luxury hotel status that is promised to guests. The customer service touches (big and small) were missing - and I feel compelled to make this displeasure known.

RESTAURANT BOOKING
On 26 April, I called Yan Ting restaurant, the hotel reservations hotline, and emailed the reservations desk to ask for assistance to book a table for 5 pax at Yan Ting on 3 May for lunch. I was told it was fully booked, but both the reservations team and the restaurant team told me that they will give me a call back to let me know once a table is made available. NO ONE CALLED ME BACKI then found out that a friend of mine dined with 5 pax on 3 May for lunch, and they only called the restaurant the day before on 2 May to get a table.

STAFF and BUTLER SERVICE (THE WORST)
I was promised a 5-star butler service that came with my suite. I would give it 1-star at best. Below are 4 incidents of incompetent and piss poor service in a 5-star hotel that promises ""uncompromising luxury"" and ""timeless elegance"".

Incident #1:
I called at 5pm to check if I can get a dress pressed by 6pm to attend a wedding at the hotel ballroom - to which the butler service said the fastest they can do it is 2-hours. I understand. So I asked them to send up an ironing board and an iron so I can do it myself. The ironing board only came up to my room at 5.40pm. How does it take 40 minutes to send up an ironing board and iron?

Incident #2:
In the evening I needed assistance to connect my mobile device to the in-room speaker. The butler service advised that android phones work better. It didn't. So they sent up a technician, who came to my room to give me an audio jack cable to connect to my phone. FYI, it has been 6 long years since headphone and audio jacks on mobile devices have been killed.

Incident #3:
I was having breakfast downstairs at 9.30am and I asked one of the staff to arrange for room service to clear table (plates, cups, leftover room service food) in my suite's sitting area. I went back up to my suite at 10.30am. IT WAS NOT CLEARED. So I called the butler - 3 times and no one picked up. I called the in-room dining hotline - no one picked up. So I had to personally go downstairs to the reception, to tell them to arrange for someone to go to my suite to clear. I waited in the hotel lobby for 45 minutes. But when i went back up to my room. It was cleared, but it was ONLY HALF CLEARED. There were still half drunk wine glasses on the table, empty popcorn buckets, trash under the coffee table. WHY WOULD SOMEONE CLEAR IT ONLY HALFWAY AND LEAVE? So I called reception to let them know... and then I proceeded to clear it myself, and left a tray outside the room. They only sent someone up again AFTER 30 MINUTES.

Incident #4:
Before I went for my lunch reservation at 1.30pm. I checked out of my room at 1.15pm, and also let the front desk staff know that I have a food item that I placed in the hotel's basement freezer the day before for storage. And I asked for the hotel to have it prepared for me to take back once lunch was done. Lunch was done, I alerted the concierge and front desk to help me retrieve my item. They COULD NOT FIND IT. And I waited in the car at the driveway for another 20 minutes while they searched.

BILLING
Received a digital copy of my bill/receipt from the stay via email. The email says ""if you have any questions, please contact the hotel at the phone number in the attached folio"". Well, I have questions but there is NO PHONE NUMBER in the attached folio. I do expect a call back from yourself or from a member of your staff to rectify this and also I have questions on the bill I was sent.",tripadvisor.com.sg,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Reservation & Pre-Arrival"", ""categories""=>[""Lack of Confirmation""]}, {""theme""=>""Check-In & Check-Out Process"", ""categories""=>[""Surprise charges or billing mistakes""]}, {""theme""=>""Staff & Service Quality"", ""categories""=>[""Rude, inattentive, or unhelpful staff"", ""Lack of staff presence when needed"", ""Poor problem resolution"", ""Over-promising but under-delivering on \""luxury\"" standards""]}, {""theme""=>""Technology & Amenities"", ""categories""=>[""Malfunctioning room technology""]}, {""theme""=>""Security & Privacy"", ""categories""=>[""Mishandling of guest belongings""]}, {""theme""=>""Value-for-Money"", ""categories""=>[""Guests feeling the experience didn't justify the high price""]}]}"
St. Regis Singapore,"I want to start off this review by saying I’ve checked out a couple of days by now, and these are still bothering me, and I checked out of the hotel not well rested at all and pissed for a few days now. 

I’ll start off with the positive first. 
Front desk was great, friendly and probably the only people in the hotel who are actually working. 

I will be breaking down the rest of my horrendous stay by department. The lady who checked me in (I didn’t get her name, korean girl, grey jacket, not wearing glass) 

Before my arrival: 
1) Email reply was from a template. Birthday became proposal. In retrospect, I should have taken that as the first red flag to cancel my booking. 

Butler:
1) I was told by front desk that on the day of my arrival I can order coffee or tea from the butler, one each per person. My partner wanted a tea first when we checked in I didn’t want anything yet, so we only ordered one drink. I later wanted to order my tea, and was told that I will have to pay for it. Well, what a wonderful paid ‘welcome drink’ then. 

2) We ordered room service and despite already putting a deposit to the account we were asked if we wanted to pay by cash or credit card. Normally I wouldn’t care, but both of us were in bathrobe, it was incredibly uncomfortable. 

Spa: 
1) I had to pay less than a dollar for the price difference which I was happy to, until the receptionist said something which I took offence on. ‘We don’t take cash, you want we can swipe $10.20 on your card, will it go through?’ I was rather shocked at that point. And she continue by saying the additional amount we charge can be your tip to the masseuse. Let’s not forget at this point this was before my treatment. So you are telling me a high end spa is asking me if $10.20 will go through in my card? And passive aggressively asking me to tip your masseuse, when I don’t even know if she is going to be good? Incredibly ridiculous. 

Breakfast: 
This lady - Doris, was frowning the entire time we were ordering. I initially dismissed it off as just her expression until she ‘tsk’ when my partner needed a few more seconds to decide what to order. For a luxury hotel, giving your guest a few more seconds would result in being treated in such a condescending manner? I don’t want to say this, but as I was observing her around the restaurant, it looks like we were the only one being treated that way, maybe because both of us are very young looking, but this was really unprofessional. 

Room cleanliness: Pillow has a sweaty and mouldy smell. The last I smelt it was in a hostel 10 years ago when I was a student. It was really bad and we couldn’t sleep well, trying to avoid smelling the pillow. 
The bathroom floor was sticky too. 

Staff attitude: When I say staff this DOES NOT include the lovely, amazing ones at the front desk, kudos to the front desk managers for training your staff so well. Every call I make by dialing 0 I can hear the staff being disinterested and often speaking in a ‘what do you want now’ attitude. Their
 words may not say it, but the tone is easily it. 

Checked out: I am not sure what they want, but they sent me my PAID bill 3 times. Once’s was at 2am. 

All in all it was such a horrible stay, I wish I could have trusted the previous reviews I read on trip advisor took my money elsewhere. For those who made your booking and is refundable, please trust me, don’t make the same mistake as me, CANCEL IT AND RUN. For those who made a booking and cannot be refunded, my condolences to your money.",tripadvisor.com.sg,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Reservation & Pre-Arrival"", ""categories""=>[""Booking Error""]}, {""theme""=>""Check-In & Check-Out Process"", ""categories""=>[""Surprise charges or billing mistakes""]}, {""theme""=>""Room Assignment & Condition"", ""categories""=>[""Poor cleanliness (dirty linens, bad odors, pests)""]}, {""theme""=>""Staff & Service Quality"", ""categories""=>[""Rude, inattentive, or unhelpful staff"", ""Over-promising but under-delivering on \""luxury\"" standards""]}, {""theme""=>""Food & Beverage Experience"", ""categories""=>[""Long wait times for in-room dining or restaurants""]}, {""theme""=>""Facilities & Infrastructure"", ""categories""=>[""Pool, spa, gym not functioning or poorly maintained""]}, {""theme""=>""Value-for-Money"", ""categories""=>[""Guests feeling the experience didn't justify the high price"", ""Hidden charges / unexpected fees""]}]}"
St. Regis Singapore,"I am very upset and angry with the hotel service I received and the employees that liase with me. I am not usually a fussy customer, however this is my first time complaining about a 5 star hotel service and employees! 

The start of my complain. Upon booking I requested for early check in and late checkout. Therefore, I called in at about 12pm to ask if the room is ready if I come at about 1pm. The employee I spoke to on the phone told me room is almost ready and I can make my way there, I should be able to check in early.

I arrive at 2:30 to find out room was not ready at all! They told me they’ll call once room is ready but no call till 3:10pm. Since I was just waiting at the lobby, I decided to approach the receptionist. Then he gave me room key. 

I requested in advance and remind when I arrive at 2:30 to do a simple deco for the room as it was my mom’s birthday. No decoration was done but they did send the complimentary cake. 

Upon booking, I did request for early check in and late checkout.

The next day, I called and they mention latest is 12:30 as there is another guest waiting to use the room. I understand that late checkout is depending on availability so we left on time.

The very next day my sister and I realise we forgot some of our expensive eyeshadow palettes in the room cabinet. I then immediately called the hotel. They told me housekeeping staff did not found any item upon cleaning.

However, they kept my case open. Later on the employee called back to confirm nothing was found. My sister called back on my behalf an employee name Hidayat assisted her. She told him exactly where the items was left. Later on, I got a call and apparently housekeeping staff found some of our items. 

My sister went to the hotel as soon I got the call as we are working just beside the hotel. It was some other less valuable items that we forgot. 

My sister insisted and requested to check in the room by herself as she was very sure the items was left in the room. The employee was reluctant but they eventually brought my sister to the room. To my sister’s surprise, it was after 24 hours since we checked out and the room was in the exact same condition like how we left. The items was found in the exact same location that my sister mentioned. This was witnessed by the employee that accompanied my sister to check in the room. We felt so cheated! Clearly the hotel staff did not bother to check for our items properly, especially at the place where we mentioned. Not only that, there was no guest right after us, we felt so cheated as the employee lied to us just deny our late check out request with the reason that there is a guest already waiting to use the room.

This is my first horrible and irresponsible experience in a 5 star hotel. I will never recommend St Regis to anyone anymore.",tripadvisor.com.sg,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Reservation & Pre-Arrival"", ""categories""=>[""Lack of Confirmation"", ""Inflexible Policies""]}, {""theme""=>""Check-In & Check-Out Process"", ""categories""=>[""Long Wait""]}, {""theme""=>""Room Assignment & Condition"", ""categories""=>[""Room not ready upon arrival""]}, {""theme""=>""Staff & Service Quality"", ""categories""=>[""Poor problem resolution"", ""Over-promising but under-delivering on \""luxury\"" standards""]}, {""theme""=>""Security & Privacy"", ""categories""=>[""Mishandling of guest belongings""]}]}"

St. Regis Singapore,"Claimed to be 5 star but service delivery attitude is more like  1 or 2 star. Waited in queue for quite some time as only 2 out of 3 receptions in operation. When one of the receptionists became available, she went to serve the Caucasian standing behind me who was clearly equally surprised. Perhaps, because I am local?!Receptionist assured there will be discount for in-room dining for Marriot member but turns out untrue. Inconsistent promotion. Staff not trained? Most impersonal butler service ever experienced,,,,,none are friendly or exudes any  genuine hospitality. They are in name and dressed like butlers  only but  behave like any other general  hotel staff in other hotels.  Received  assurance  that clothes will be ironed and returned (given within the  stipulated time frame) before dinner but clothes turned up after I left for the dinner (in shorts & T-shirt). in-room dining food tasted terrible. All the food taste same but are just titled different names. Went to the spa, Everything is minimalist including missing staff at spa reception.  Cannot find an extra bath-robe when the one given got wet.  Overall, one of my worst staycation ever. Not worth the money or the time spent unless you are Caucasian and dress 'atas'?

St. Regis Singapore,"Booked a staycation to rest and celebrate Chinese New Year Eve and First Day of the Year at this hotel. My review based on personal encounter is as in the following points which the hotel needs to take note of, I would like to to share the points which I have experienced during my stay which led me to come to my given rating of 1. 1. Upon arrival at the park entrance, the doorman or usher would be the first sign of welcome to at least handle my luggage to be uploaded from the car if the car passenger door was not opened. You can experience this first hand at Marina Bay Sands, a 5 star hotel. 2. During check in at the front desk, check-in processing was smooth. However, I didn’t feel the welcome and continuity when I tried to make conversation with the personnel. 3. The room is very nicely furnished but the television is not user friendly. Hence, at one point I couldn’t even access the channels after turning it back on. 4. I visited the pool and upon enquiry to take a look at the premises. I was warned that if I used the pool without a booking and when a check is done I would be solely responsible for my actions. This is not something which I would like to hear during my stay from a service staff of the hotel. 5. When I made a Grabfood delivery to be received on the first day of CNY, I realised that my delivery would have to be self collected at the front desk upon enquiry. Upon my arrival to collect, the hotel service man even knew what room number the delivery is for and enquired with me before handing it over. So the last day of my stay, I personally went down to wait for the delivery rider to receive it at the entrance of the hotel. My observation is that this point can be improved and considered to at least offer a delivery up the room by the hotel staff if possible. 6. Overall, it was quite a strange stay for me at this hotel. It is very grand but yet the level of service is not very welcoming for guests in my experience. I would like to hear from you via this email what can be done even after my sharings because of receiving this rating of 1?",tripadvisor.com.sg,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Check-In & Check-Out Process"", ""categories""=>[""Poor service""]}, {""theme""=>""Room Assignment & Condition"", ""categories""=>[""Maintenance issues (broken AC, shower, TV, etc.)""]}, {""theme""=>""Staff & Service Quality"", ""categories""=>[""Rude, inattentive, or unhelpful staff"", ""Over-promising but under-delivering on \""luxury\"" standards""]}, {""theme""=>""Technology & Amenities"", ""categories""=>[""Malfunctioning room technology (smart locks, lighting, automation)""]}, {""theme""=>""Facilities & Infrastructure"", ""categories""=>[""Pool, spa, gym not functioning or poorly maintained""]}, {""theme""=>""Value-for-Money"", ""categories""=>[""Guests feeling the experience didn't justify the high price""]}]}"
Marina Bay Sands ,"We were given a room on the second floor, which made it feel more like being part of a shopping mall than a hotel. I wouldn't recommend queuing in Tower 3 upon arrival, as these rooms are closest to the main road, meaning you'll hear traffic noise 24/7. There's no view, making it pointless to spend hundreds of dollars just to access an infinity pool. Save your money and go for an infinity pool experience in Dubai instead. This hotel definitely seems geared towards privileged individuals who come for gambling. Lobby staff indirectly inquire about your purpose of visit to hotel, likely so they can assign better rooms to those who are there to gamble while their partners are shopping.",booking.com,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Room Assignment & Condition"", ""categories""=>[""Wrong room allocation (e.g., not the one booked)""]}, {""theme""=>""Staff & Service Quality"", ""categories""=>[""Poor problem resolution (slow or dismissive responses)""]}, {""theme""=>""Facilities & Infrastructure"", ""categories""=>[""Noise issues (thin walls, nearby construction, events)""]}, {""theme""=>""Value-for-Money"", ""categories""=>[""Guests feeling the experience didn't justify the high price""]}]}"
Marina Bay Sands ,"This hotel was supposed to become the best stay on our holiday, but instead it became the worst. On that holiday we stayed in 11 different hotels, but Marina Bay Sands really disappointed us, which was a shame as it was the last stay before returning home. When we arrived at 3.45pm (which was 45 minutes after check in started) we found a long queue at the reception. I understand this a large hotel, but queuing for 30 minutes at a 5 start hotel just to check in is not a great start. At 4.15pm we finally got to the check in assistant. Check in took 10 minutes. At 4.25pm the assistant told us that our room was not ready and that she doesn'y know when it will be ready. We couldn’t believe it. Marina Bay Sands is not just a roof swimming pool or an observation deck. Marina Bay Sands is first of all a 5 star hotel. And the fact that our room was not ready on time is completely unacceptable. For a 5 star hotel this is a fiasco. We had to spend 35 minutes by the roof swimming pool, although the pool was closed due to a pouring rain. At 5pm we received an email that our room was ready. It has been 2 hours since the check in started. To get into the room we had to go back to the reception and exchange our temporary passes into the regular ones. Unfortunately, we had more issues. In the morning my husband found that his pass stopped working - he couldn’t use the lift or get back into our room so he had to go back to the reception again. When the reception replaced his pass, he went to the lift again and still couldn't use it. After replacing the pass for the second time, he could finally get back to our room. This service is again unacceptable for a 5 star hotel. We left quite disappointed with the value we received for the price. We expected a first class experience in everything, but such a horrible check in process and the issue with non-working passes really ruined our impressions about this hotel. This hotel is not worth the price, we will not come back there.",booking.com,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Check-In & Check-Out Process"", ""categories""=>[""Long Wait"", ""System Errors""]}, {""theme""=>""Room Assignment & Condition"", ""categories""=>[""Room not ready upon arrival""]}, {""theme""=>""Technology & Amenities"", ""categories""=>[""Malfunctioning room technology (smart locks, lighting, automation)""]}, {""theme""=>""Value-for-Money"", ""categories""=>[""Guests feeling the experience didn't justify the high price""]}]}"

Hospitality is ridiculous. It feels like you’re in a DisneyLand for adults… if that’s your vibe then it’s your place. If you’re looking for something exclusive and distinguished, it’s definitely not. Honestly, it feels like rooms are given out for free. Our room toilet was dirty when we arrived and they didn’t even say they were sorry.

Marina Bay Sands ,"Dear Marina Bay Sands Team, As you may have known, the foot of my mom is injured by the sharp sofa leg on October 8th 11:40pm. The cut has been bleeding for an hour until the doctor arrived on October 9th 0:30 and it has been painful for her. While we were waiting for the doctor, we used our first aid tool kit, with 30 iodine tablets to wipe the blood and clean the wound. The blood shed like water in the first place, bleeding on the floor and in the washroom tank, but my mom was too anxious to take a picture at that moment. Attached are the pictures I took for her, including the sharp sofa leg and doctor prescription, as well as proof for the following content I will discuss shortly. There has been something that I had to report. As an international traveler aiming at luxurious experience, this is the first time a hotel stay is so unacceptably hilarious. During our wait for the doctor, the security team came and sent a so-called first aid kit. However, they cleaned my mom’s wound with iodine first, then tried to wipe the wound with tissue, which may have cause bacteria infection. As such, I asked them to stop and provide us with more iodine wipes instead. Also, I have kindly reminded Cynthia and the front desk representative, Josef OOI, that staff members here would need more training of first aid. As the hotel is still undergoing renovations, we are the first group of guests that came visit and got injured, more guests might face similar dangers in the future. In short, you have to be prepared. For any effective risk management department, it is wise to note the problems in advance and avoid similar issues from happening again. Nevertheless, Josef responded to me that he’s “not first aid trained”. This irresponsible answer is unacceptable. Being a manager myself, I would never ever allow my team to treat any risks using avoidance as a strategy. If you are not trained, train yourself.",booking.com,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Room Assignment & Condition"", ""categories""=>[""Maintenance issues (broken AC, shower, TV, etc.)""]}, {""theme""=>""Staff & Service Quality"", ""categories""=>[""Poor problem resolution (slow or dismissive responses)"", ""Over-promising but under-delivering on \""luxury\"" standards""]}, {""theme""=>""Facilities & Infrastructure"", ""categories""=>[""Pool, spa, gym not functioning or poorly maintained""]}, {""theme""=>""Security & Privacy"", ""categories""=>[""Safety concerns (doors not locking properly, lack of visible security)""]}, {""theme""=>""Value-for-Money"", ""categories""=>[""Guests feeling the experience didn't justify the high price""]}]}"

Marina Bay Sands ,"I stayed in Singapore for four nights. My friends and I flew from America and South Korea to reunite (a 22 hour flight for me). We stayed our first three nights at Oasia Downtown (which was phenomenal) and splurged for a room at Marina Bay Sands on our final night. I upgraded our room to premier specifically for the view—paying around $1500.00 for what was supposed to be a special night with friends. Unfortunately, my stay at MBS was the worst lodging experience we had while in Singapore. Upon arrival, an employee of the hotel by the check-in line asked me and my friends if we were Deluxe (the cheapest rooms) or Premier. I told him, “I’m pretty sure we’re Premier, but I’ll check my reservation.” His response, “I’m pretty sure you’re Deluxe.” I showed him my reservation confirmation, Premier. He said he was sorry and walked away from the area before I could catch his name. This man made a value judgement upon looking at us, and it was insulting. Then, our room was not ready at 3:30pm (30 minutes after check-in). We asked the hotel to store my friend’s insulin in a refrigerator until our room was ready as this was time sensitive—and keeping her insulin cool a must. We were told our only option was to accept a room on the 8th floor if we needed to store the insulin right away. We had no choice. The view was not what we payed for, and it was extremely disappointing. Additionally, guests at the hotel made a status judgement of me when getting off at the 8th floor. I was literally called poor. For $1500 for one night, we were looked down upon by guests and staff alike. I messaged the hotel, and I did not hear back from them until late at night, saying our room was technically premier (in spite of being on one of the lowest floors). While they admitted they handled the situation poorly, they did nothing to rectify the situation. Was the view from the pool nice? Sure. Was the hospitality of the staff or the accommodations worth $1500?

Marina Bay Sands ,"A hilariously poor experience. - I ordered wine from room service and it did not come in over 1 hr, with no notice from them.

Marina Bay Sands ,"When we arrived at the hotel, we were shocked to find out that our reservation had been canceled without any prior notice. The hotel staff claimed that Booking.com was responsible and that we should take up the matter with them. Despite our efforts to resolve the situation, we were left without a room and were asked to pay a cancellation fee. We spent hours in frustration, trying to sort things out with the hotel, even calling Booking.com, who assured us they had not canceled our booking. The hotel seemed indifferent to our predicament. Ultimately, the hotel canceled our reservation without informing us and tried to charge us for their mistake, leaving us stranded. With no other options, we had to spend the night in a substandard room because we had nowhere else to go. It’s clear that the hotel’s popularity has led to poor customer service, as they cater mainly to large groups and delegations. While the hotel might be in a desirable location, there are plenty of other hotels in Singapore that offer similar amenities without the hassle. The breakfast situation was chaotic, with long waits and overcrowded dining areas, making the stay feel more like a chore than a vacation. If you value peace and efficiency, I would recommend looking at other hotels in the area.

I tried to contact the Bank of Mexico due to the time difference, it was very difficult. This situation ruined all my plans, that incredible dinner I planned was ruined, I couldn't order a drink at the infinity pool. It became so frustrating that at 11 pm I decided to leave the hotel.

Marina Bay Sands ,the hotel is an iconic structure but the rooms and furniture or old and pathetic.

I felt I was cheated by the looks of it and booking.com with Marina Sands Bay Hotel not providing proper information to the customers about the new refurbished rooms in some floors of Tower 1 and Towers 2. I was given in Towers 3 which is quite old and needs an immediate redo of rooms before they keep it for customers to book.

An employee immediately appeared who impolitely instructed me that I can't put my foot in the flip-flops in the water! The bar is also a disaster - there was only one bartender for a huge mass of customers. As a result, we waited 20 minutes in the scorching sun for our drink. Rude staff in front of the the restaurant at the entrance to the pool (I don't know the name of the place). I wasn't allowed to get in because of the ""dress code"" (I was wearing short trousers, T-shirt and sandals). But moment later the guard let in a woman in much shorter trousers. What is it about?

The entire check in experience was painfully long and drawn out. From the moment we arrived we were treated like we were inconveniencing the hotel staff by being there, our bags where taken in storage before we even completely jumped off the taxi and we were told we cannot get the bags till we checked into our rooms. We had to request multiple times to have our bags returned and eventually after hours we received the bags. A portion of our group had to go make other arrangements for accommodation at another hotel which resulted in additional costs for us. The check in process was tedious, when we arrived we were told that we can only start check in at 6am as we arrived at 2am the reception also advised us that we can only early check in from 6am, there were no waiting rooms or lounges made available to us and we were told to wait in the middle of the reception area till 6am. There was one staff member that advised we could wait at the back of another reception area as there are 2 seats available there, At 6am we started the check in process and only after payment was completed did the reception advise we cannot do an early check in and we need to wait till 3pm to get a room! They advised they can offer temp cards to give us access to some of the facilities but they could not be used as they are closed or temporary closed due to weather, We then went back to the back reception area which had the 2 seats and around 8am was told we cannot use this area to wait and we have to find another area And again no waiting area or lounge was made available to us, we had to make alternate arrangements to find an area we could wait at till 3pm.

Marina Bay Sands ,"he design of the room was actually quite basic for a 5 star resort, I guess my expectation was lot higher. The bathrobes was poor quality or just tired, the free complimentary drinks was nice but would like fruit as well. It normally a nice touch to have a complimentary gift for memory of your stay, they lack this gesture. Maybe more expensive suites get it but personally for prestige of the hotel, there should not have any prejudice.

I patiented till 2 pm or so , I coudlnt work and do mly job. I was going to crack mentally, my colleague went down to the reception , saying that this was not acceptable, they were still trying to keep us happy, with some excuses. we had to loose our temperer in public, and they made my colleague quiet and offered me another room in A block. I paid very big amount to stay in this amount and the service received for this amount is absolutely horribl e and that i have to experience this.

Marina Bay Sands ,"My disappointment runs deep. Upon my arrival around 11 AM, not only was my request for an early check-in disregarded, but I found myself forced to change in a cramped restroom marred by unsanitary conditions, including urine drops on the floor, with no alternatives offered. Lacking any suitable surface to place my luggage, I resorted to capturing photographs of the unpleasant scene. Compounding matters, the absence of complimentary shower shoes—commonly provided by all 5-star hotels—left me with no choice but to wear my conference shoes to the swimming pool. Despite patiently awaiting communication regarding my room's readiness while at the pool, several hours passed without any contact. Faced with both frustration and a sunburn, I eventually returned to the lobby to inquire about the status of my room. Regrettably, the staff displayed a lack of urgency in addressing my situation, despite my earlier plea for prompt assistance. Following a frustrating ten-minute wait and subsequent computer search, I was finally allocated a room. It pains me to say that the demeanor of the lobby staff fell far short of the expected standard for a five-star establishment—marked by unkindness, sluggishness, and a noticeable lack of care.",booking.com,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Reservation & Pre-Arrival"", ""categories""=>[""Inflexible Policies""]}, {""theme""=>""Check-In & Check-Out Process"", ""categories""=>[""Long Wait"", ""Poor service""]}, {""theme""=>""Room Assignment & Condition"", ""categories""=>[""Room not ready upon arrival""]}, {""theme""=>""Staff & Service Quality"", ""categories""=>[""Rude, inattentive, or unhelpful staff"", ""Poor problem resolution (slow or dismissive responses)"", ""Over-promising but under-delivering on \""luxury\"" standards""]}, {""theme""=>""Technology & Amenities"", ""categories""=>[""Missing promised amenities (minibar, toiletries, etc.)""]}, {""theme""=>""Facilities & Infrastructure"", ""categories""=>[""Pool, spa, gym not functioning or poorly maintained""]}]}"

Fullerton Bay Hotel,We got in around 1044 pm and the was no one manning the door to greet us. We had to lug all our baggage up the stairs and across to the back desk. We booked a club room. We thought we were booking a better room but it was featureless and tired with no decoration. The furniture was tired and scuffed and the carpet frayed at the edges. But the worst thing was the carpet and the bedding really smelled awful. We looked online and saw several people had complained about the smell. We were late and tired and initially thought we would address it in the morning but the smell was so bad we couldn’t stay. We had to ring the duty manager and ask to be moved. By the time we were moved it was 2 am. The room they moved us to was cheaper but much nicer but we paid the full initial price for both nights. Though they gave us a restaurant credit of $200 an arranged a taxi to the airport when we left I was firstly amazed that they had put a guest in such an awful room and then despite us not being able to access a usable room till 2am they still charged the full price for the room.

Don’t go during peak hour as the hotel was understaffed and they seemed to be scrambling to get our room ready (it took them over an hour and with a toddler in tow and us hanging around and waiting for our room to be ready, it was tense). When we went to the pool, there was no one there to provide us with towels so we were pretty much shivering. Plus when we went to get our breakfast, I asked one of the staff for an extra bowl for my toddler and she couldn’t understand basic English. She had to complain to another one of her colleagues and that colleague came to clarify with us the same request. Room service was also horrendous. We clicked on the do not disturb button for our room but right after I managed to tuck the toddler to bed, the noisy phone rang where the reception asked us when they could come to clean the room up.

Shangri-la Rasa Sentosa,irstly it would be nice if female partners were acknowledged especially by the pool. The staff acknowledge the men (I guess this is tip driven) but it is just manners to greet all guests. This was a constant disappointment. Food was average but unless you are prepared to leave the island all the time you have to take hotel offering - very overpriced. Sea shells require breakfast booking but you still line up to check in and wait for a table. There is a queue for guests without booking which is much shorter as most people do the right thing - these people were seen to and seated immediately and those who booked waited in a line to be seated.

I had requested for a baby cot which was also acknowledged by the hotel staff, but upon arrival we had an extra bed in the room which we didn’t ask for and the baby cot was nowhere to be found. We had to make an additional call for the changes to be made. It could be understandable if it took time for the baby cot to be brought to the room, but it is just distasteful to be allocated a room with someone else’s arrangements as if we were made to take another’s leftover room even when we paid the same. The staff were also not as meticulous in carrying out their work.

I communicated this request to your front desk team on August 4th and August 6th. However, when I attempted to check out with my family on August 7th, I was informed that I would need to pay an additional day's room fee.

JW Marriott South Beach,"1. Poor Check-in Process & Customer Service: When we were doing the check-in, we were directed by staff to switch between 4-5 different counters. Even at the final 5th counter, the system went down & we had to wait again. There are some hotels that do online check-in, with no humans involved, so not too sure why JW’s system is so poor, considering they are a 5-star hotel. When we finally could check-in, the staff supporting us looked unhappy and she explained the check-in process in a very convoluted manner. She did apologise at the end but the damage was already done. 2. Poor Coordination: On our last day, we requested to do a late check-out. The hotel agreed and said that all was settled. After coming back from breakfast, we went up to the room but were not able to access the room. We called the concierge at the lift lobby and they informed that we had to come back to the main entrance lobby level to settle the cards. After coming down to the main entrance lobby level, they informed us that the cards need to be re-validated here. I told them that they should have informed us earlier, rather than making us do double trips to settle a mere hotel card. They could have also offered to bring up a card for us. 3. Poor Customer Service Recovery: As we shared feedback with them on the above card issue & the poor check-in process, the concierge staff brushed us over and kept glancing at her computer. When we went back to our hotel room, the hotel left us a missed call. When I called back & told them I received a missed call, they asked me what I was calling for. I was puzzled and repeated that this was a missed call. They told me then everything should be fine. When we were finally checking out, I asked them how to do the express check-out.

The Ritz-Carlton ,"Having recently stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Singapore, I must confess my disappointment with the overall experience, especially considering the exorbitant price tag attached to the stay. While the hotel boasts a prestigious reputation and is positioned as a five-star establishment, I found the disparity between cost and quality quite glaring. Firstly, the outdated facilities and decor were evident throughout the property. Despite its esteemed status, the hotel appears in dire need of renovation, with worn-out furnishings and aging infrastructure detracting from the luxury ambiance one would expect from a Ritz-Carlton establishment. Moreover, the room rates charged seemed unjustifiable when compared to the amenities and services provided. While I understand the allure of a prime location in Singapore, it hardly justifies the premium pricing, especially when rival hotels offer comparable accommodations at a fraction of the cost. Additionally, the level of service fell short of the standards one would anticipate from a five-star hotel. While staff were polite, their efficiency and attention to detail left much to be desired. Simple requests often took an inordinate amount of time to be fulfilled, and the overall guest experience felt lacking in personalization and warmth. In conclusion, while the Ritz-Carlton Singapore undoubtedly holds a prestigious reputation, it fails to deliver commensurate value for the exorbitant prices charged. Prospective guests would be wise to explore alternative accommodation options that offer superior quality and service at a more reasonable cost.",booking.com,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Room Assignment & Condition"", ""categories""=>[""Outdated or worn-out furnishings""]}, {""theme""=>""Staff & Service Quality"", ""categories""=>[""Poor problem resolution (slow or dismissive responses)"", ""Over-promising but under-delivering on \""luxury\"" standards""]}, {""theme""=>""Facilities & Infrastructure"", ""categories""=>[""Pool, spa, gym not functioning or poorly maintained""]}, {""theme""=>""Value-for-Money"", ""categories""=>[""Guests feeling the experience didn't justify the high price"", ""Comparing negatively to other 5-star or boutique hotels""]}]}"
The Ritz-Carlton ,"The staff's attitude felt discriminatory. 1. After checking in, we went for a walk. When we entered the hotel through the side door and passed the bar, a staff member caught up with us and asked what we wanted. His tone and attitude were not good. 2. I asked the day before and was told that breakfast reservations were not available. The next day, when the waiter showed us to our seats, we wanted to switch to a window seat, but was told that ""someone had made a reservation."" Is this a reasonable answer? Also, the hotel facilities are old. There are sounds of air conditioning and unknown high-pitched noises, which should be the sound of the machine running. The tissue paper in the room is too rough, and there is only one copy. If you put it in the bathroom, there will be no paper available in the room... The kettle is also old!",booking.com,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Staff & Service Quality"", ""categories""=>[""Rude, inattentive, or unhelpful staff""]}, {""theme""=>""Room Assignment & Condition"", ""categories""=>[""Maintenance issues (broken AC, shower, TV, etc.)"", ""Outdated or worn-out furnishings""]}, {""theme""=>""Food & Beverage Experience"", ""categories""=>[""Limited menu choices vs. premium expectations""]}, {""theme""=>""Facilities & Infrastructure"", ""categories""=>[""Noise issues (thin walls, nearby construction, events)""]}]}"
The Ritz-Carlton ,"We had to wait quite a long time for our room, even though we arrived long after check-in time and had to ask three times for missing bedding. Queue for breakfast was between 5 and 30 minutes, depending on the day. The room started to show it's age. AC kept resetting itself, sink drain was not working, standpipe door couldn't be closed.",booking.com,"{""themes_and_categories""=>[{""theme""=>""Check-In & Check-Out Process"", ""categories""=>[""Long Wait""]}, {""theme""=>""Room Assignment & Condition"", ""categories""=>[""Room not ready upon arrival"", ""Maintenance issues (broken AC, shower, TV, etc.)"", ""Outdated or worn-out furnishings""]}, {""theme""=>""Food & Beverage Experience"", ""categories""=>[""Long wait times for in-room dining or restaurants""]}]}"
